This famous woodblock map is presented on an oval projection surrounded by clouds and wind heads with the title above the map.  The continents are shown in rough outline only.  North America is shown with the large cleft nearly separating the east coast from the continent, often referred to as the Sea of Verazano.  What appears to be a large 
Northwest Passage
 stretches towards Asia.  South America has a very strange shape as well.  In Africa, the Nile is prominently shown with its twin sources beginning in a range of southern mountains. The mythical islands of

This spectacular map on Mercator's projection is one of the largest world maps ever produced for an atlas.  The cartographic details include the prominent 
insular California
 and recent discoveries in the South Pacific and northern Japan.  There is a large inset of the North Pole depicting the potential regions where either a 
Northwest, or Northeast, Passage
 might soon be found.  Correspondingly, the tracks of Henry Hudson, Thomas James, Willem Barents, in their search for this elusive northern passage to Asia, are traced on the map.  Another inset world map shows the magnetic variations of the compass in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans based on recent English observations with Woodes Rogers' corresponding track through the Pacific shown on the large map.  The trade winds and currents are graphically shown in the oceans.  The map is filled with fascinating comments and annotations including Moll's advertisement for a new set of maps, in which he warns his clients not to purchase or subscribe to inferior works, such as those of Moses Pitt.  The superb title cartouche, designed by Louis Cheron, features allegorical scenes representing Christianity and paganism, and unusual 
male
 figures representing the continents: a knight for Europe; a Turkish soldier for Asia; and native warriors for both America and Africa; and a resting, but watchful, lion representing Britain.  A secondary title is contained in a rectangular cartouche at bottom.  The map consists of four joined sheets.  


Herman Moll was one of Britain's most prominent cartographers of the first half of the 18th century.  He emigrated from Germany and went to work as an engraver for Moses Pitt in 1678.  Soon he joined one of London's most interesting social circles, which gathered at Jonathan's Coffee House, and included stock speculators, scientists, archaeologists, authors, pirates, and sea-captains.  From these friends, Moll gained a great deal of privileged information that he compiled into his cartographic works.  Moll's success and prosperity was due in part to his social connections and political astuteness, and to his distinctive style and quality workmanship.  He produced a great number of often-innovative maps, charts, globes, atlases and geographies.  His best known works are the large maps produced for his 
World Described
 (and also published separately) including this world map and the famous 
Beaver
 and 
Codfish
 maps of North America.

Traubel, and Davis, Porter & Co. who were competing against the larger Milton Bradley and McLaughlin Brothers in this growing category.  The map is dated circa 1865 as Wyoming Territory had not yet been organized from Dakota Territory (here shown as attached to Dakota), and Nevada has not yet gained its southern tip from Arizona and eastern portion from Utah.  The 24-piece puzzle is made from thick, 3/8"" wood and is housed in a solid wood box with paper title label attached to the top featuring the United States seal.  The banner is filled with a quote from Shakespeare's 
Titus Andronicus
 stating ""The Eagle Suffers Little Birds To Sing.""

This is one of the most famous maps of America and one that had enormous influence on the future cartography of the New World.  Frans Hogenberg engraved this map and it is primarily based on Gerard Mercator's great multi-sheet world map of 1569.  The map features an exaggerated breadth of the North American continent, with a lengthy St. Lawrence River reaching across the continent to nearly meet the fictitious, westward flowing  
Tiguas Rio
.  The strategically placed title cartouche hides the unknown South Pacific and therefore most of the conjectural great southern continent, which is shown attached to both New Guinea and Tierra del Fuego.


This is the third of the plates that Ortelius used of the Americas, evidenced by the removal of the bulge on the southwestern coast of South America and an added cartouche in North America.  Also on this plate, the Solomon Islands are noted for the first time since their discovery in 1568, and the names 
California, R. de los estrechos
, and 
C. Mendocino
 have been added to the west coast of North America.  The native name of 
Wingandekoa
 has been added to the eastern coast, originating from an unsuccessful attempt to colonize the Outer Banks by the English.  Latin text on verso, published in 1592.

Full original color on paper with Ortelius' common crossed arrows watermark.  There is minor color offsetting at bottom center and a hint of toning along the centerfold.  A centerfold separation that enters less than 1"" into image at bottom has been archivally repaired on verso, and an old paper repair confined to bottom blank margin on recto is toned.  Margins are trimmed but ample for framing.

This is one of the most famous maps of the Americas and an important foundation map for an American map collection.  After the death of his grandfather, Michael Mercator produced this stunning hemispherical map, the only known printed map attributed to him.  The map is surrounded by a beautifully engraved floral design and four roundels, one of which contains the title.  The other insets include the Gulf of Mexico, Cuba, and Haiti.  The geography was patterned after Rumold Mercator's world map of 1587, with a little added detail.  There is a large inland lake in Canada, and the St Lawrence River extends nearly halfway across the continent with no Great Lakes.  There is a still a bulge in the west coast of South America.  The large southern continent extends above the Tropic of Capricorn in the Pacific where there is a very large island of New Guinea.  Above North America are two of the four islands of the North Pole, with the great mythical rivers flowing from the pole.  The seas are full of mythical islands, including 
St. Brendain, Frislant
 and 
Sept citez
.  Latin text on verso.

This rare, magnificent map of the Americas is derived from Jodocus Hondius' map of 1618.  Joannes Jansson was married to Elisabeth Hondius, sister of Jodocus, and was a prominent publisher in Amsterdam.  In 1623 he produced a set of continental maps derived from those of his brother-in-law, which in turn were largely derived from those of Blaeu.  North America retains the peninsular California and there is not a lot of detail along the eastern coast in the mid-Atlantic region.  In the Southwest the famous seven cities of Cibola appear on the banks of a large spurious lake.  In South America, there is a large inland sea in Guiana and two engraved scenes, one detailing a cannibalistic feast and the other showing a mythical giant of Patagonia.  Two stylized insets of the polar regions are enclosed in strapwork cartouches; the North Pole depicts Frobisher's theory of the Northwest Passage and the South Pole shows the long-held notion of the mythical southern continent.  


The map is flanked on three sides with carte-a-figures borders describing the native Americans and the major cities.  This map can easily be distinguished from Hondius' map because the figures at the sides were reversed when they were copied by the engraver, the cartouche bears two skulls, and most extant examples were printed from the plate after the top right corner was damaged.  The map was first issued with a panel of cities across the bottom, but that was removed for inclusion in the slightly smaller format atlases after circa 1632.  This is the third state with German text on verso, published in 1638.

A nice impression with full original color.  This example has been professionally conserved and backed in thin, archival tissue to repair a complete separation along the centerfold, a 5"" tear at right, a 2"" tear adjacent to the centerfold at bottom, and several other tears and cracks primarily confined to the carte-a-figures borders.  There are a number of cracks and small areas of loss in the vignette at top left, with a small portion of the image replaced in facsimile.

This rare derivative of Hondius' influential map of 1618 is a reduced version of a map of the same title by Petrus Bertius & Melchior Tavernier (1627).  The map improves on Hondius by completing the coastline of Tierra del Fuego.  California is still shown as a peninsula, although the Baja Peninsula is now isolated by two oddly crossed rivers, opening the possibility that it may be an island.  The western coast of America is elongated and filled with place names, and there is a large inland sea in New Mexico.  The Great Lakes are only suggested, and the region of New England is named 
Norumbega
.  South America has tiny engraved natives and trees, and two large mythical lakes, 
Eupana
 and

This map of the Americas is based on Henry Seile's map of 1652.  For unknown reasons, after Henry's death his plates passed to Philip Chetwind.  His widow, Anae, engaged Robert Vaughan to engrave a new plate for her own publication of Heylin's 
Cosmography
.  Therefore, this is one of the few maps published exclusively by a woman, with her own imprint.  The map is very similar to the earlier map, although the nomenclature of the Delaware River, Carolina and several places on the west coast have been changed.  It depicts 
California as an Island
 and no Great Lakes.  It is decorated with a title cartouche, sea monsters, and sailing ships.

Very unusual map depicting all of South America and most of North America.  The map is totally devoid of political detail with the exception of the floating city of Mexico, shown a bit too far north, and California is named.   Instead the map features the principal rivers, lakes, mountains and volcanoes in South America.  A huge crater lake, probably Lake Titicaca although it is situated too far north, is depicted as the source of the Amazon.  The Andes are shown as a range of live volcanoes.  Three sailing ships and a strapwork title cartouche adorn the map.  Kircher is credited with publishing the first book describing the ocean's currents and this map is a beautiful example of his representations that are surprisingly accurate.

Sumptuous map of the Americas features a dramatically decorative title cartouche showing an Amazonian queen surrounded by riches, a sugar cane field and exotic animals.  Inset in the cartouche is a small map of the coast of New Zealand.  The cartography of North America includes all five Great Lakes and the
 island of California
 on the Foxe model with two indented bays on the northern coastline, and a string of spurious islands off the tip of California.  Above California is a huge landmass labeled 
Terra Esonis
 that stretches nearly to Japan and Yedso.  The Mississippi River is beginning to take shape with the 
R. Massourite
 (Missouri) making its appearance.  Sanson's 
R. del Norte
 has been revised here so that there are two branches, one flowing correctly into the Gulf of Mexico and the other emptying into the sea between the mainland and the island of California (Mare Vermio cum Mare Rubrum).  Interestingly the 
Apaches
 de Novajo
 region has moved considerably north where an unnamed river flows westward to the head of the Mare Vermio
.  In South America the mythical Lake Parime is no longer shown and the major river systems are beginning to take their proper shape.  The Portuguese 
capitanias
 are delineated along the coast of Brazil.  There are several islands shown in the Pacific including a coastline in the vicinity of Australia labeled 
Quiri Regio
.  This is the second state of the map according to Burden.

This is a very curious and fascinating map of the Americas.  There are several interesting features that don't appear on other maps of the period.  Senex's depiction of the northwestern part of North America is most unusual with the coastline continuing far to the north of the 
island of California
.  Two lakes (L. Aquinanbock and L. of Isles) appear along the coastline with the place names (
Desolation
 and 
Zapezipin
) and several offshore islands.  The western interior is filled with a huge lake labeled 
The Great Lake of Thoago or Thoya
, from which two rivers flow to the Pacific.  Another remarkable feature of the map is a wide unnamed river flowing from Carolina into the Gulf of Mexico.  South America takes on an unusual shape with the mythical 
Parime L
 and enlarged Rio de Plata.  The splendid title cartouche is decorated with natives, parrots, turtles, serpents and scenes of battle and cannibalism.  The map is dedicated to the Earl of Berkshire, Deputy Earl Marshal of England and engraved by John Harris.  Mead Cain attributes the source of the map to Robert Morden, whose map also includes the odd Northwest coastline and fallacious river flowing from Carolina.

Handsome and important map by Guillaume Sanson, who in partnership with Pierre Mariette, based this map on his father's scarce 1666 wall-map of North America.  This depiction replaced Nicolas Sanson's landmark map of 1650 in this atlas.  Cartographically it is an amalgam of Sanson's maps of ""Le Canada, ou Nouvelle France"" and ""Le Nouveau Mexique, et La Floride.""  The Arctic bears the confused cartography typical of this date, with Greenland shown as three islands, and another three island masses in Baffin Bay.  The map extends to include Iceland, as well as a bit of Britain.  Lake Erie is shown in a recognizable form and the entire Great Lakes network is shown in greater detail, although still with the western lakes open-ended.  On the East coast, Long Island is shown near the 
R. de Nort
, or Hudson River, and the shape of the Outer Banks is improved.  Delaware is noted as 
N. Suede
, the first such place name on a printed map referring to the Swedish colony located there in 1638.  The 
island of California
 is now shown with an indented northern coast, in the form originating with Luke Foxe's map of 1635, and popularized by Sanson.  Several Indian tribes are identified in New Mexico where the 
R. del Norte
 (Rio Grande) mistakenly flows from an interior lake and empties into the 
Mar Vermeio ou Mer Rouge
 (Gulf of California).  First state of this map.

This is an uncommon, updated version of 
Carte de la Nouuelle France et de la Louisiane...
 that was published in Hennepin's third work, the 
Nouvelle Voyage d'un Pais plus grand que L'Europe
, published in 1698.  The map is most notable for its depiction of the river and lake routes into the interior and the Great Lakes region. Particularly, the delineation of Lakes Superior, Michigan and Huron are a marked improvement on Sanson's open-ended versions.  Even with these improvements, the lack of accuracy is very evident; the lakes are enlarged and exaggerated, Hudson Bay is too far to the east and the Mississippi River too far to the west with its mouth in what is present-day Texas.  An inset depicts the Pacific Northwest, with the 
Land of Iesso
 and 
Japon
 noted very near Asia.  California is not shown as an island on this example.  The extravagant, pictorial cartouche more than makes up for the simple cartography.  This is the second state per Burden with the imprint of Gaspar Bouttats at lower left. 


Louis de Hennepin, a Franciscan missionary, accompanied LaSalle in the explorations of the Upper Mississippi.  After LaSalle returned for additional supplies, Hennepin and his party were captured by Sioux Indians.  While traveling with the Indians, Hennepin discovered the falls where Minneapolis now stands, and named them St. Anthony Falls, in honor of his patron saint.  Rescued in 1681 by Sieur du Luth (Duluth), Hennepin returned to Europe where he published accounts of his journey with some embellishments including a claim that he preceded LaSalle to the upper Mississippi.

This handsome map features the 
island of California
, which is labeled New Albion, discovered by Sir Francis Drake anno 1577.  The general outline of the continent follows Father Louis Hennepin's cartography, and the discoveries in the Mississippi Valley are attributed to him.  However, the map makes use of fresh sources, especially in the region under English control. Several English settlements are located along the eastern seaboard.  A New French Settlement near the mouth of the Mississippi relates to d'Iberville's colony at Biloxi that was founded in 1699.  The most notable alteration in the interior is the Ohio River, which is here named the 
Hotico R
.  It is shown flowing through the 
Apalachin M
., which inexplicably run east-west in an arc that encloses the Spanish possessions of Florida.  The Northwest consists of 
Parts as yet unknown
, the Great Lakes are rather distorted, and a large mythical lake still appears in Carolina.  The map is dedicated to His Highness William Duke of Gloucester, with his coat of arms in the title cartouche.  It was drawn and engraved by Michael Burghers, the official engraver of the University of Oxford.  This is the fourth state of the plate with the additional names St. Johns and Timagaming appearing above Quebec.

From 1681 to 1683 Vincenzo Maria Coronelli worked in Paris to construct a massive pair of globes for Louis XIV.  During this time he had access to court documents including the manuscripts of La Salle.  He also made the acquaintance of Jean Baptiste Nolin, who was the royal geographer.  Upon his return to Venice in 1684, he became royal cosmographer of the Republic of Venice, and began compiling maps for his great atlas, the 
Atlante Veneto
.  He prepared two-sheet maps of both North and South America in 1688 for inclusion in this atlas, which was first published in 1691.  In 1689 with the agreement of Coronelli, Jean Baptiste Nolin published reduced-sized, single sheet versions in Paris.  They included all the important cartographic advances of the larger maps, but different French-style cartouches.  


This spectacular map of North America features 
California as an island
 on the Foxe model with two indented bays at top.  A note near the peninsula of 
Agubela de Cato
 speculates on the location of the Strait of Anian.  A major cartographic innovation is the depiction of the Rio Grande (
Rio Bravo
) emptying into the Gulf of Mexico rather than the Gulf of California.  Another influential feature (though incorrect) is the depiction of the Mississippi River, which is located too far west and flanked by a massive mountain range.  This information for the Mississippi was based on reports from the La Salle expedition.  The Great Lakes are shown quite accurately for the time, with Lake Ontario named 
Frontenac
.  The Chesapeake Bay is shown a bit too wide, and the fictitious 
Lake May
 is noted just south of the Appalachians, which are an isolated group of mountains rather than a long range.  There are numerous notations on the map regarding explorer's travels.  The decorative cartouche incorporates two horns of plenty that empty their contents of treasure into the waiting hands of a native and a European.  This is the third state, with Coronelli's name removed from the title cartouche.

This example has been dissected into 6 sections and mounted on modern linen with a decorative paper title label on verso.

Hubert Jaillot, successor to Nicolas Sanson, was the most influential French cartographer of his day.  In partnership with Sanson's sons, Jaillot revised and reissued a number of Sanson's maps, one of which is this map of North America first published in 1650.  While maintaining much of the same information as Sanson's map, this fifth state demonstrates the changing cartography of the continent at the beginning of the eighteenth century. 


In Jaillot's first edition (separately published in 1674), the depiction of the Mississippi River basin is based upon Richelet's 1670 literal translation of the route traced by De Soto.  Jaillot succeeded for the first time in transposing information from the discovery of the Mississippi in 1542 to a map with any pretense of accuracy, some 133 years later.  Although Jaillot maintained the fictitious 
Bahia del Spiritu Santo/Mer Pequina
 found on both the earlier Chauves map (1584) and De Laet's map (1630), the easternmost river feeding the bay carries the name 
Chacagua River
.  Chacagua was the Indian name for the Mississippi River.  This 1719 edition largely follows the same model as the first edition, but the 
Missisipi
 is delineated in the Franquelin/Coronelli spirit, with detail in the headwaters, showing the Ohio River, and adding considerable new geography in the Great Lakes. 


In the West, California is no longer in island shape and appears more like a peninsula, though the question of its insularity remains due to a gap at the head of the 
Mare Vermejo
 and a missing northern coastline. The seventh and final state in 1783 clearly showed California as a peninsula, with the northwest coast of the U.S. also delineated.  Also corrected in this edition is the route of the 
Rio del Norte
 which now flows into the Gulf of Mexico instead of the Gulf of California. 


Other interesting features of this map include a mythical lake in present-day Georgia, and the naming of the northern colonies of 
Mariland
, 
Pensilvanie
, and 
Nuov. York
. The French claim in the southeast is named 
Caroline
. The lion's share of today's United States is divided between 
Louisiane
 and 
Nouveau Mexique
. There are scores of place names, forts, and Indian tribes. A lovely title cartouche by C. Simonneau with Native Americans and tropical birds appears at upper left, balanced by the distance scale cartouche on the right. Engraved by Louis Cordier.

Watermarked paper with original outline color and later color in the cartouche.  There is toning along the centerfold and a short centerfold separation at bottom that has been archivally repaired.

This scarce map was published in a French account of the voyages of Francisco (Francois) Coreal, a Spaniard, to the West Indies from 1666-97.  The authenticity of Coreal's account, and indeed his identity itself, has been called into question due to the fact that there is no Spanish edition of his account, and some therefore believe that Coreal's account is actually a compilation of the travels and discoveries of other explorers.  This map appeared at the beginning of the first volume, and illustrates several cartographic misconceptions.  The 
R. Longue
 extends west from the Mississippi River to 
Gnacsitares
, based on the reports of Baron Lahontan.  Southern Florida is composed of several large islands and a narrow peninsula.  A notation in the northwest indicates that the area is little known, and several dotted lines allude to the possibility of a northwest passage or 
River of the West
, which would begin to appear frequently on French maps in the mid-eighteenth century.  The mythical 
Parime L.
 still appears in South America.


Jean Baptiste Nolin is given credit in the title cartouche, as the map is largely copied from his folio-sized map 
L'Amerique ou le Nouveau Continent
 [1720], however it is unlikely that Nolin was involved in creating this smaller edition.

Issued folding on watermarked paper with light offsetting and an extraneous crease at bottom left.  Several short fold separations in the map and a chip at right just entering the border have been professionally repaired on verso with old paper.

This map was published a decade after the American Revolution and focuses on the new territorial boundaries in North America.  A chart at bottom right lists the lands belonging to the United States and the European colonial powers, including Britain, France, Spain, the Dutch Republic, and Denmark.  Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia are contained east of the Appalachian Mountains, with the Western Territory extending to the Mississippi River and remaining open-ended in the northwest.  The Western Territory is filled with numerous Indian tribes and the preliminary outlines of the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Illinois.  
Ft. Checagou
 is noted on Lake Michigan.  Florida is still under Spanish control and is divided into East and West.  The western United States, also under Spanish control, is labeled Louisiana, New Mexico, and New Albion and includes several spurious mountain ranges.  The Rocky Mountains are correctly illustrated in northern Canada, but then veer east towards Minnesota north of the 
R. Oregan
, which nearly connects the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean via a large bay labeled as the 
Entrance of Juan de Fuca
.  The map was created circa 1792 due to the identification of the ""state of Vermont"" (which had achieved statehood in March 1791) in a key in the Atlantic, yet the fact that Kentucky, which achieved statehood in June 1792, is not yet marked as a state.  Another clue to the publication date is the existence of 
Mackenzies River
 leading to the Canadian Arctic, based on Alexander Mackenzie's 1789 expedition, yet no sign of his 1792-93 expedition to the Pacific Ocean.  Also missing are any references to George Vancouver's expedition to the Pacific northwest from 1792-94.


This map was based on the work of Jean Palairet, with significant updates and improvements by Louis Stanislaw d'Arcy Delarochette based on maps by D'Anville, Mitchell, and Bellin, as noted in the title.  Published by Carrington Bowles & Jonathan Carver.  This map is similar to

Alaska is shown in an inset.  The maps in this atlas were all presented on a uniform scale (1: 1,641,836), and each map covered an area of approximately 10 degrees longitude (from Paris) and 6 degrees of latitude.  The maps were meant to be joined together to form a huge globe measuring 7.775 meters in diameter.  It was also considered to be the first lithographic atlas ever published.  Only one edition of the atlas was published in 1825-27, and the subscription list shows that just 810 copies were sold; thus the maps are very scarce on the market today.

This lot contains two interesting maps illustrating the status of Indian nations in the United States in the middle of the 19th century.  The two maps are included in the original 
Some Account of the Conduct of the Religious Society of Friends Towards the Indian Tribes in the Settlement of the Colonies of East and West Jersey and Pennsylvania
, which was published by the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers as they are more commonly known.  It was produced for the Aborigines' Committee of the Meetings of Sufferings in London, 1844.  The Quakers held these meetings every year, in which they focused on the wrongs suffered by aboriginal peoples all over the world.  Both of these maps were drawn by Jim Bowden and lithographed by H. Clark.  The  report, 247 pp, is bound in brown marbled boards with leather spine. 
 

A. 
A Map of North America, Denoting the Boundaries of the Yearly Meetings of Friends and the Locations of the Various Indian Tribes
 (21 x 18.5"").  This map shows the United States all the way to the West Coast with a great 
Republic of Texas
 reaching into present-day Colorado.  The United States has no claims to the Southwest yet, and the northwest border with Canada and the U.S. has been left undefined due to the unsettled claims in that region.  The extent of immigration and developed territories is confined to east of the Mississippi.  The map names all the known tribes and where they are located with a color key at left that also informs us that the Catawba, Uchee and Natchez Indians are extinct.  A key shows the location of annual Friends meetings and a table at the right notes the number of tribal members of each tribe and also how many had, at that point, been moved from their homelands. 


B. 
Aboriginal America, East of the Mississippi
 (4.3 x 6.5"").  The map shows the United States to the Mississippi River.  It names the known tribes and locations with a color key at right that names the Algonquin, Dahcota, Huron - Iroquois, Catawba, Cherokee, Uchee, Natchez, and Mobilian Indians.

Condition code is for the maps.  
A Map of North America
 has light toning along a few folds and in the corners, light scattered foxing mostly along the edges of the map, and a tiny binding tear at left.  The 
Aboriginal America
 map has overall light toning and scattered foxing.  Text is clean and bright with light scattered foxing primarily confined to the first and last 20 pages, including the title page.  Front cover and spine are detached at top, and the covers and spine also are lightly worn with a few small abrasions.

This pocket map was published at the end of the California Gold Rush and was created to show ""all the routes to California.""  This was also a time when many territorial borders were in interesting configurations.  Eight large territories make up the majority of the Western United States, which would later become 15 different states.  These territories include Washington, Oregon, Northwest, Minnesota, Utah, New Mexico, Nebraska, and Indian Territory.  The map is filled with many details including rivers, railroads, wagon roads and Indian tribes and extends to include portions of Canada, Central America, northern South America and all of the Caribbean islands.  Sea routes between various ports are displayed along with 5 vignettes of sailboats and steamships and at lower left is a table listing distances between ports.  Surrounded by a decorative border.  The original boards are no longer present.

Issued folding, now flattened and backed in heavy tissue to provide support and repair fold separations and a few minor tears.  There are a few very small areas of loss around fold intersections, and light toning along a few folds.

This huge wall map of North America was created by G. Washington Williams and published by John M. Atwood.  This map was published the same year that Colorado achieved statehood, and shows Dakota Territory and Indian Territory.  Yellowstone National Park is given its own boundary lines.  The map is densely engraved with towns, counties, roads, railroads (both existing and proposed), and topography.  A number of insets fill the blank areas of the ocean: Newfoundland, New England, the North Atlantic Ocean, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Hawaii, Alaska, the Pacific Ocean, and Japan.  The map appears to be derived from Mitchell's 
New National Map, Exhibiting the United States with the North American British Provinces...
, which was published in 1857 and 1860 and was engraved by Wellington Williams.  It is likely that G. Washington Williams is the son of Wellington Williams.  The publisher, John Atwood, was also an engraver, creating maps for Colton, Phelps, and others.  Dissected into 36 sections and backed with linen.  Includes 2 of the 4 original metal rings at top to hang the map.  Folds into blue paper self-wrappers and fits into original red cloth slipcase with gilt titling on cover.  A very rare issue, with only 2 sales records found in the last 35 years.

Light toning with minor soiling.  Very good condition for such a large map.  Slipcase is moderately worn and soiled, with the bottom of the slipcase separated along three of the four edges.

This is the uncommon first edition of Delisle's important map of the region with the Rue des Canettes address.
  This important map is credited with accurately showing the course of the Mississippi River and its mouth for the first time.  It was compiled partly from the reports of important French expeditions of La Salle, Bienville and Iberville.  It is an attractive map that includes much of the present-day United States, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.  The map correctly shows the Great Lakes region, the English settlements along the East Coast, and the early Spanish and Indian settlements in what are now Texas and New Mexico. The early native settlement of 
Checagou
 (Chicago) is named on Lake Michigan, called 
Lac des Ilinois 
after the native tribe.  The name of 
Checagou
 refers to the wild garlic that grew abundantly there.  The map influenced later delineations of the Mississippi River by Seutter, Homann, Lotter and others for many years.  The decorative cartouche was engraved by C. Simmoneau.

A sharp impression on watermarked paper with original outline color and later color in the cartouches and long the coastlines.  There is light toning, scattered foxing, a printer's crease adjacent to the centerfold at bottom, and an extraneous crease along the centerfold at top.  There is paper tape along the top edge of the map on verso.

This is the index sheet of the Dutch version of Henry Popple's important map of the British Empire in North America, published by Covens and Mortier.  Popple's map is the finest and most detailed map of America of its time and covers the eastern part of North America between the Mississippi River and Newfoundland and the adjoining regions of Central and South America and the Caribbean.  Popple relied on numerous sources in creating his map, including Delisle, De Fer, Colonel John Barnwell, James Edward Oglethorpe, and Cadwallader Colden.  Despite Popple's use of up-to-date sources, cartographical errors still remain.  Lake Ontario is depicted in a southwest to northeast orientation, rather than its nearly east-west orientation.  Lake Michigan is called by the old French name of 
Lake Illinois
.  A large lake filled with small islands appears in the area of present-day South Dakota.  Popple's map was also criticized for relying too heavily on French sources and therefore showing land claims that were unfavorable to the British.


Despite the geographical inaccuracies, Popple's map was filled with splendid artistic elements.  In upper left and right hand corners are insets of Niagara Falls, Mexico City, Quebec and New York City.  At right is a column of 18 plans of ports, harbors and islands including Cartagena, Charleston, Bermuda, New York, and Boston.  The map is richly embellished with a title cartouche featuring Native Americans, monkeys, a crocodile and a scene of European traders.  Numerous ships and sea battles are shown throughout the oceans that are hachured to depict current directions.  Engraved by Johannes Condet.

Fine original color and impression with very light toning and a few unobtrusive spots of foxing.  There is a tiny hole in wide blank margins, well away from map.

Greenhow was the translator and librarian to the Department of State, a leading authority on the Northwest, and a strong advocate for American growth into that region.  This map includes all of the western half of North America extending from Russian Possessions in Alaska, south to Acapulco, Mexico, east to Lake Michigan and west into the Pacific to include the Sandwich Islands.  The 
Independent Republic of Texas
 shows S. Antonio de Bexar and Austin and names Ft. Alamo, which is rarely called out on maps, including other editions of this map.  Other editions show Washington as the capital of Texas, but the town is not on this issue.  Pre-Fremont geography is depicted in the West.  The U.S. - Canadian boundary is undefined, reflecting Greenhows advocacy of American claims in the area.  The map locates Ashley's Lake and Lost and Inconstant Rivers.  The Buenaventura River flows into the Swamp Lakes & Is., with the Sacramento River flowing from it.  A large inset shows the North Pacific Ocean.  Today's British Columbia is 
New Caledonia
.  A vignette shows the front and back of a medal struck at Boston in 1787 to commemorate the departure of ships Columbia and Washington for an early exploration by the U.S. to the Pacific Northwest.  Drawn by David H. Burr, this map was also published as Sen. Doc. 174, 26th. Cong, 1st Sess.

This is the first and finest edition of Mackenzie's famous account of his epic journeys to the North and Northwest composed in two volumes - first to the Arctic Ocean in 1789, and second to the Pacific Ocean in 1793.  Alexander Mackenzie was the first white man to cross the North American continent north of Mexico and thus totally dispel the belief in a 
Northwest Passage
 from Hudson Bay.  His courageous voyages were ones of incredible hardship and mark an important page in the cartographic history of North America.  Mackenzie's writings on his journeys came to the attention of Thomas Jefferson and served as the catalyst to Lewis and Clark's famous expedition to the Pacific Northwest.  Included in his remarkable account are three very important and rare maps: 


A.  
A Map of Mackenzies Track from Fort Chipewyan to the North Sea, in 1789
 (22 x 23.4"").  This basic map charts the 1,100-mile Mackenzie River, traveling from the Great Slave Lake to Mackenzie Bay in the Arctic Ocean.  Mackenzie had been following Peter Pond's false prediction of a river that led from the Great Slave Lake west to the Pacific Ocean, but instead ended up in the Arctic. 


B.  
A Map of Mackenzies Track from Fort Chipewyan to the Pacific Ocean in 1793
(22 x 23.6"").  This map is sparsely engraved with detail only in the regions adjacent to his trek from Fort Chipewyan to Finlay Forks, south along the Parsnip River (headwater of the Peace River), then down the Herrick and McGregor Rivers to the 
Great Fork
 with the Fraser River (which he mistook for the upper Columbia).  He followed the river until the rapids just above Williams Lake and then made his way on foot along established native trails to the Pacific at the mouth of the Bella Coola River.  


C.  
A Map of America, between Latitudes 40 and 70 North, and Longitudes 45 and 180 West, Exhibiting Mackenzies Track from Montreal to Fort Chipewyan & from thence onto the North Sea in 1789, & to the West Pacific Ocean in 1793
, hand color (17.3 x 30.5"").  Shows the entire track of both the 1789 and 1793 expeditions from Montreal to the Arctic Sea and then on to the Pacific Ocean.  Inland detail is limited to the river system, lakes and Indian tribes mainly along his route. 


After his journeys, Mackenzie retired back to his native Scotland as a wealthy fur-trader, where he wrote the 
Voyages
, published in London in 1801.  412 pages including three folding maps and an engraved portrait frontispiece.  Quarto, hardbound in quarter leather with tips over marbled boards with gilt title and embossing on spine.

The three folding maps have light offsetting, a few tiny splits at fold intersections, and binding tears ranging from 1.5"" to 3.5"" in size.  The Map of America also has uneven toning at left and right.  Text has light toning and occasional minor foxing.  A previous owner's bookplate is on the front pastedown, and there is offsetting of the frontispiece on the title page.  There is moderate wear to the extremities with warped boards, bumped edges and cracking along both joints (separated at top).

This separately issued map is based upon Samuel Holland's earlier map of the region with ""many late additions and improvements.""  It presents the area from the Canadian/New York border near Massena northeast along the St. Lawrence River to Montreal and Quebec City.  The map is divided into the districts of Montreal, Three Rivers, and Quebec with a key identifying court houses, churches, mills, iron works, roads, and lines of old French grants.  The 
Battle of Crysler's Farm
 is noted in the lower left portion of the map, which was a significant victory for British/Canadian forces during the War of 1812, and caused the United States to abandon their St. Lawrence Campaign.  Engraved by H.S. Tanner and published by Lay & Webster in Philadelphia.

Louis Armand, Baron de Lahontan served ten years in the French military in Canada, was involved in the Indian Wars, and commanded several posts in the west.  He traveled extensively in the Wisconsin and Minnesota region and the upper Mississippi Valley.  Upon his return to Europe he wrote this enormously popular travelogue.  In it he embellished his knowledge of the geography of the Great Lakes region, invented Indian tribes, and created several fictions, particularly the 
River Longue
, which he claimed extended from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains.  Over twenty editions of his book were published between 1703 and 1741, including editions in French, English, Dutch and German.  The immense popularity of the book resulted in his distorted cartography being accepted by several eminent cartographers who incorporated the ""Lahontan"" concepts into most 18th century maps. 


Volume 1 is the 1704 French edition containing three folding maps and 11 single page plates of illustrations.  
Carte Generale du Canada en Petit Point
 (3.5 x 5.5"") shows the Great Lakes, Boston, Manhattan (Manat) and the Saint Lawrence.  It locates the lands of the Iroquois, Fort Niagara, Fort de S. Joseph, Sault Ste. Marie, Montreal and Quebec.  
Profil de la Ville de Quebec
 (8 x 3.6"") is a bird's-eye view of Quebec with an extensive key below locating important buildings.  The river is filled with French ships and the fleet of the British slightly down river.  The third map is one of the most influential, and fanciful maps in American cartographic history, entitled 
Carte que les Gnacsitares ont Dessine sur/ Carte de la Riviere Longue et de Quelques Autres 
 (11.5 x 5"").  It purports to show the 
Riviere Longue
 flowing from the mountains in the west, home to the Gnacsitares Indians, and connecting to the Mississippi River.  On the western side of the mountains is another river, presumably flowing into the Pacific.  Lahontan's concept was copied by virtually all 18th century cartographers including Moll, Senex, Popple, and Delisle, thus perpetuating the myth.  The map also includes balloon-shaped Lakes Superior and Michigan.  This is the rare first state with ""Tom 1er Pag. 136"" at upper right.   This first state has several differences with later maps including Mississippi written as 
Missisippi
.  Complete with 14 engravings and maps, 280 pp.  Bound in original full brown calf, spine tooled in gilt with raised bands. 


Volume 2 is the 1709 French edition of this important book.  It includes 10 single-page illustrations and the 
Petit Dictionaire de la Langue des Sauvages
, a very early Algonquin and Huron dictionary. No maps are present in this volume.  210 pages with a 17 page index.  Also bound in original full brown calf, spine tooled in gilt with raised bands. 

The maps, plates, and text are generally clean and bright.  
Carte que les Gnacsitares
 has a few spots of foxing at right, and both this map and the Profile of Quebec has minor soiling.  Volume one has light wear with minor abrasions on the covers and mild cracking of the spine.  Volume two has moderate wear to covers and spine with a chip to the rear board.

This is a great map filled with details including Indian tribes, forts, and other political and geographical information.  It covers primarily the United States, but extends to include a good portion of Canada, the western parts of which are largely still the domain of several Indian nations.  The cartography in the west is primarily taken from the explorations of Lewis and Clark and dotted lines trace the Hunt and Stuart routes.  
Texas is an Independent Republic
 in its small format.  Missouri Territory occupies all of the Midwest.  The Pacific Northwest is labeled 
District de la Columbia
, which stretches into present-day British Columbia.  Arkansas Territory is shown at its largest extent even though by the time of this publication it had already assumed its final borders.  Two large lakes in today's Utah drain via rivers to the Pacific, as defined by dotted lines.  The Colorado River ends in the desert east of San Diego and the title covers the Gulf of California.  This interesting map was published by Colonel Pierre Lapie (1777-1850) and his son Alexandre Emile, who was the Royal Geographer to the King in Paris.  The map was engraved by Pierre Tardieu, a foremost French 19th century engraver.

This is the German edition of Hennepin's significant map which focuses on the region of French influence in North America.  It is most notable for its depiction of the river and lake routes into the interior and the Great Lakes region, particularly the delineation of Lakes Superior, Michigan and Huron, which are a marked improvement over Sanson's maps.  Even with these improvements, the lack of accuracy is very evident;  the lakes are enlarged and exaggerated, Hudson Bay is too far to the east and the Mississippi River too far to the west with its mouth in what is present-day Texas.  This German copy was produced one year after the French edition (1697), and while it has a German title, the place names remain in French. 


Louis de Hennepin, a Franciscan missionary, accompanied LaSalle in the explorations of the Upper Mississippi.  After LaSalle returned for additional supplies, Hennepin and his party were captured by Sioux Indians.  While traveling with the Indians, Hennepin discovered the falls where Minneapolis now stands and named them St. Anthony Falls, in honor of his patron saint.  Rescued in 1681 by Sieur du Luth (Duluth), Hennepin returned to Europe where he published accounts of his journey with some embellishments, including a claim that he preceded LaSalle to the upper Mississippi.

This is the western sheet of Mortier's interesting map that is filled with various geographic misconceptions of the late seventeenth century.  The map is based on Robert Morden's important map of 1698, 
New Map of the English Empire in America
, even though the cartouche credits 
le Sieur S.
 (Nicolas Sanson).  The area shown extends from Hudson Bay to the Gulf of Mexico.  The Mississippi, 
R. Mitchisipi ou Rio Grande
, enters the gulf too far west; an error resulting from the intentionally faulty reports of French explorer La Salle.  The coastal areas are filled with names including 
James Tovum
 on the well-defined Chesapeake Bay.  The map has both French and English names including a mention of a 
Copper Mine
 near what would become Chicago.  The Great Lakes are all present, but with some odd shapes; Lake Michigan is square in shape and Green Bay is very elongated and named 
Bay de Puans
 (Bay of evil smells).  A prominent mountain range begins in the Michigan peninsula and runs all the way down through Florida.  This spurious feature is one of the most mysterious geographic mistakes in the mapping of North America.  The notorious errors derived from the reports of John Lederer (
Ashley Lake
, the 
Savana
, and the 
Desert Arenosa
) are present in 
Caroline
.  Boston Harbor is inset at the upper left; the first example of an English colonial city on a map that did not originate in England.

Derived from Nicholas de Fer's important four-sheet map of 1718, this is the most informative map of the French possessions in North America in the early 18th century.  Louisiana and the Mississippi Valley are based on Delisle's manuscript map of 1701, while the geography of New England and eastern Canada originates with Franquelin.  Inset at top left is a large-scale map of the Mississippi Delta and Mobile Bay, based on the voyage of Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville.  Another inset plan and view of Quebec is enclosed in a very decorative cartouche at bottom right.  The map is filled with wildlife, scenes of Indians hunting, Indian villages and notations, and the oceans are embellished with numerous ships, canoes and sea monsters.  It was issued to promote the recently established Compagnie Francoise Occident, which was formed to fund the debt of Louis XIV and offered inducements to encourage settlement in Louisiana.

A striking and informative map derived from Nicholas de Fer's important four-sheet map of 1718.  It describes the French possessions in North America in the early 18th century.  Louisiana and the Mississippi valley are based on Delisle's manuscript map of 1701, while the geography of New England and eastern Canada originates with Franquelin.  Inset at top left is a large-scale depiction of the Mississippi Delta and Mobile Bay, based on the expedition of Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville.  A large architectural style cartouche at right encloses both a view and plan of Quebec.  The map is filled with minutely engraved wildlife, scenes of Indians hunting, Indian villages and notations.  The oceans are embellished with numerous ships, canoes and sea monsters.  It is very similar to Chatelain's map of the same title, but this has a more elaborate Quebec inset cartouche and a simpler border for the inset map of the Gulf Coast.  De Fer's large map was issued to promote the recently established Compagnie Françoise Occident, which was formed to fund the debt of Louix XIV and offered inducements to encourage settlement in Louisiana.  This smaller version is found in atlases published by Ottens and other Dutch composite atlases.  There is no engraver or publisher's imprint.

A sharp impression with full original color and a few small damp stains primarily in the Atlantic Ocean.  There are archival repairs to several short cracks, but the paper is otherwise very supple.

This important map was issued at the outbreak of hostilities in the 
French and Indian War
.  The detailed map depicts the entire eastern seaboard from northern Florida to the Strait of Belle Isle, and the Great Lakes region up to Lake Michigan and eastern Lake Superior.  The American interests of France, England and Spain are shown in great detail and color-coded.  Fort Duquesne is shown in two different places on the map - according to DAnville and also to Jefferys.  A large inset shows the upper Mississippi River valley with the important frontier forts.  A smaller inset shows the lower Mississippi and Gulf Coast.  A small vignette of Niagara Falls adds further interest to this fascinating map. 


This is the second state of the map with two color-coded keys to the right of Nova Scotia identifying the ""pretensions"" (claims) of both the English and French.  Le Rouge later updated the plate in 1777 and retitled it to 
Theatre de la Guerre en Amerique
, and the map also made an appearance in Francois Soules' 
Histoire des Troubles de l'Amerique Anglaises
, published in 1787.

This is the first French edition of John Mitchell's monumental map of eastern North America published by George Le Rouge.  It is considered by many to be the most important map of America every produced.  The map was so widely regarded that it was used as the source document to determine the new boundaries of the United States at the Treaty of Paris in 1783.  The map continued to be used for nearly all boundary disputes between Canada and the United States in the 19th century. 


John Mitchell was a doctor by training, but was also a noted botanist and philosopher.  He earned a master's degree in Edinburgh, he spent most of his first 35 years in eastern Virginia.  By 1746, however, Mitchell discovered that the climate in Virginia was too difficult on his health and he moved to London.  Through his interest and contributions to botany, he became a member of the Royal Society.  It was through this association that he became acquainted with prominent members on the Board of Trade & Plantations.  During this time, Mitchell composed a large map of North America based entirely upon public sources in order to educate the British public about the encroaching French.  While Mitchell himself believed his map to be inadequate, the commissioners of the Board of Trade were impressed enough to request he make a more detailed map as it had been decades since the last significant map was produced (Popple).  Unlike his first map, Mitchell had full access to all available maps belonging to both the Board of Trade and the British Admiralty. 


Mitchell's source maps and charts included Fry and Jefferson for Virginia, Christopher Gist for the Ohio Valley, and Colonel John Barnwell for the Southeast.  He also consulted French sources in the Mississippi Valley, but was cautious with this information so as not to take a French point of view in this contentious region.  The final result of Mitchell's compilation was a decidedly British view of the region.  The map's boundaries are color-coded to show the possessions of the English (yellow), French (blue), and a huge area in green west of the Appalachians showing contested lands.  In this disputed region, Mitchell prominently depicts the British claims of Virginia and the Carolinas extending well beyond the Mississippi River and off the map and presumably ""to the South Sea"" per the original charters.  A note along the left border of the map indicates that the sources of the rivers and the country beyond this map are not well known.  Another notation along the Missouri River indicates that it flows to the west a distance equal to that of the Ohio River flowing east, demonstrating a common belief at the time of symmetrical geography.  The overall level of detail provided is unlike any preceding map and includes copious useful notations describing the land, rivers, Indian tribes, and earlier explorations.  Topography and hydrology is well represented, as are the numerous Indian villages, forts, and trading paths.  An inset at top left depicts the region around Hudson Bay, and the map is adorned by a decorative title cartouche. 


There were 21 variants of this map published between 1755-1781, with this being the first French edition.  This example has been dissected into 32 panels and backed with old linen as issued.  The original ribbon hangers at top are present and intact.  When folded, the map measures approximately 14"" x 10"". 


***Please use the second and third images for high-resolution inspection***


The map is in overall very good condition with original outline color.  There is light surface soiling, occasional printer's ink residue, and some minor separations of the linen that does not impact the map sheets.  There is one short split at a fold intersection at lower left resulting in insignificant loss of an unengraved area of the image.  Trimmed to the neatline all around, as issued.

This very historical map illustrates the British colonies after the 
Treaty of Paris
 and at the conclusion of the 
French and Indian War
 in America.  The treaty ended French colonial ambitions in North America with minor exceptions.  As a result, Spain ceded East and West Florida to Great Britain, France relinquished the title to the Louisiana Territory to Spain, and the Mississippi River was established as the British-Spanish Boundary.  The map reflects the claims of the southern colonies that their charters extended to the Mississippi River.   Also of interest are the names and locations of many Indian tribes and nations located away from the more populated areas of English settlements.  An inset of East Florida on the same scale lies between the coastline and the decorative rococo-style title cartouche.  A simple compass rose rests in the Atlantic.

This uncommon map is based on the surveys of Captain Jonathan Carver and was issued during the 
Revolutionary War
 period.  This particular map was issued in both 
The American Military Pocket Atlas,
 also known as the 
Holster Atlas
 carried by British redcoats, and Thomas Jeffrey's 
American Atlas.
  The western boundaries of most of the thirteen colonies are left open, but the colonial claims extend to the Mississippi River.  A key at the upper left lists the British territories claimed in North America, including the Hudson Bay Company lands, the 
Reserved Lands
 west of Appalachia to the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, in addition to both 
East and West Florida
.  A notation west of Hudson Bay notes that if there is a Northwest Passage, it would be through one of the inlets attached to Hudson Bay.  The decorative landscape cartouche depicts the boxes of tea from the 
Boston Tea Party
 of 1773 as well as the paddles the Bostonians used to push any recalcitrant floating boxes back into the sea.  This is the second state of the map with the addition of ""Improved from the Surveys of Capt. Carver"" in the title cartouche.

This is the second English edition of Francois Alexander Frederic La Rochefoucald Liancourt's account of his travels in Canada and the United States.  A supporter of the French monarchy, La Rochefoucald Liancourt fled to England and then the United States during the French Revolution.  He spent 3 years in exile in North America and published an account of his experience upon returning to France in 1799.  His work describes in detail the political constitution, natural history, physical geography, agriculture, and the customs of the inhabitants of the United States.  Included are three folding maps:


A. 
Map of the United States, Canada the River St. Lawrence, the Lakes &c.
 (13.3 x 16"").  This great map of the fledgling nation includes numerous areas of interest.  In New England, Maine is shown with a truncated northern boundary, reflecting the British view of the border dispute.  Georgia's western boundary is the Mississippi River.  Florida, at the time a Spanish territory, is divided into East and West, with the notation ""Land Claimed by the United States"" on the northern boundary on the 31st parallel.  The proposed state of 
Franklinia
 is located in eastern Tennessee.  This 'state' of Franklin was formed in 1784 by a group of 
westerners
, with John Sevier appointed as Governor.  Due to some fascinating political intrigue, Franklinia was never recognized by Congress and eventually was re-annexed by North Carolina.  The region west of the Mississippi River (present-day Missouri and Arkansas) is named 
Morgania
, which at the time was Spanish territory.  In an effort to protect New Orleans and trade on the Mississippi River, the Spanish employed the assistance of an American named Col. George Morgan to establish a colony in a vast tract of land opposite of the mouth of the Ohio River.  The colony, also known as New Madrid, lasted but a short while, due to yet more political intrigue and to extensive flooding of the Mississippi.  Engraved by Smith & Jones.  Condition: Light offsetting and a short binding tear that has been closed on verso with archival tape. (B+)


B. 
Map of the Southern Provinces of the United States
 (19.8 x 13.5"").  This interesting map covers all of the Carolinas with parts of Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Georgia.  Features great detail of early roads and settlements.  Between Tennessee and Georgia is a long strip of land labeled 
United States Territory
.  This land originally belonged to South Carolina but was ceded back to the United States in 1787.  Numerous Indian villages are shown, especially in the region of present-day Alabama.  Engraved by John Russell.  Condition: A dark impression with scattered foxing and minor offsetting. (B)


C. 
Map of the Northern Provinces of the United States
 (19.8 x 12.6"").  This map covers all of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, extending south to below Alexandria and west to beyond Wheeling on the Ohio River.  Early county development in Pennsylvania is current to 1794, prior to the organization of Greene and Lycoming Counties.  The 
Lands of the Six Nations
 appear in western New York beside Lake Erie.  There is very good detail of roads throughout the region.  Engraved by John Russell Jr.  Condition: Moderate foxing with light offsetting and a tiny binding tear at right. (B)


Also included are nine folding tables outlining the number and types of criminal convictions, the types and amounts of exports and imports between the United States and England, and several tables related to the functioning of the government of the United States and each individual state and territory.  Octavo, 4 volumes: Pp. xvi, 591, [16]; 523, [16]; 717, [21]; 610, [8].  Hardbound in full leather, gilt tooling on spine with red leather title label.

The map provides excellent detail of Indian tribes, towns, settlements, roads, land grants, etc.  There are several interesting notations concerning treaties including the treaty with Britain establishing the northern boundary in 1818, the treaty with Spain establishing the boundary with Texas in 1819, and various treaties with the Indians. Other notations locate Indian hunting grounds, trading places, and the place where the 
Tribes meet in Friendship to collect Stone for Pipes
.  Several bounty land grants are shown including Colonel Simmes Donation Lands from the Commonwealth of Virginia, New Jersey, Wabash, Army Lands, Lands Reserved for Virginia Troops and North Carolina Troops in western Kentucky and Tennessee, and Carver's Grant in Northwest Territory.  The map features 
The Twenty Leagues Line
 located off of the east coast that marked the exclusive maritime jurisdiction of the United States.  This map was originated by William Faden in 1777 under the title ""The British Colonies in North America.""  It went through a long series of revisions, each incorporating milestone developments in U.S. history.  According to Tooley this is the 12th issue, published by James Wyld, successor to Faden.

This is an important and early geological map by Sir Charles Lyell.  Color-coded key identifies 20 different geological units.  The map extends to about the 110th meridian to include the 
Republic of Texas
, Arkansas, Missouri, and the 
North West Territory
.  Lyell had two major and controversial goals in publishing his work and this map: first, he endeavored to establish a strict 
uniformitarian
 theory of the earth's geology, and also to standardize the terminology and methodology employed in the science of geology.  This theory posits that the laws of nature are unwavering through space and time.  His map, along with James Hall's work of 1843, is a landmark improvement in geological representations and mapping.

Samuel Parker was a missionary who accompanied a fur-trading party on an expedition from Council Bluffs, Iowa to the Oregon Territory.  At the time, the region was claimed by both the British and the United States and was little known except to fur-traders.  The folding map 
Map of Oregon Territory, 1838
 (22.4 x 14""), and the wood engraving of the Basaltic Formations on the Columbia River are both present in this complete volume.  Parker's map, based on both personal observation and reports of the fur-traders of the Hudson Bay Company, is considered a landmark in the mapping of the region.  The map provides an excellent view of the river systems and tribal territory.  It shows several forts, including an early depiction of Fort Hall. The map extends to include much of present-day Canada.  The map is still bound in the original book in which Parker tells of his incredible experiences on the expedition.  The books preface refers to the map as being ""far more accurate than any which has before been published.""

The map is clean and bright with a small hole that appears to be a paper flaw in an unengraved part of the map at bottom left.  The plate is toned and the text has light, scattered foxing.  One of the signatures is loose at the back, but the binding is otherwise sound.  The covers and spine are lightly worn and sunned.

This rare, important guide is packed with useful information for travelers.  Bound into the front of the volume is a large, folding 
Map of the United States Including Louisiana
 (22.5 x 18"").  The map features an unusual, early ""stovepipe"" configuration of Texas with a narrow panhandle trailing northwesterly into the Rocky Mountain region.  A note located in the interior portion of Texas states that ""this part of the Provincias Internas is but imperfectly known; no scientific traveller having ever explored, the wide range from St. Antonio de Behar to Red River.""  Louisiana is shown with its current boundaries for the state and also in its large territorial configuration.  The Missouri Territory is named, but not delineated.  Also included is a small folding map entitled 
Chart of Mobile, Perdido & Pensacola Bays
 (8 x 8""), and an untitled single-page diagram of a township & range survey system.  Sabin notes two maps, while Howes calls for three (the diagram being the likely difference).  311 pages plus a 13 page index.  Octavo, hardbound in original, full leather with gilt title on spine.

The folding map has original outline color with light toning and offsetting, minor repaired fold separations, and a 6"" binding tear at right that also has been repaired on verso with archival material.  Text has light toning and scattered foxing, and the small folding map of Pensacola has moderate toning.  Light shelf wear.

This important map of the United States shows the existing (finished and unfinished) railroads in the eastern states with a proposed railroad shown beginning at Prairie du Chin and stretching toward the Pacific and terminating at South Pass, Wyoming.  The map portrays the United States prior to the acquisition of California and the Southwest, with a large Oregon Territory and a large Texas.  The map, engraved by O.H. Throop, was issued for Asa Whitney's report to Congress issued in 1846 and 1848.  


Asa Whitney was one of the first backers of an American Transcontinental Railway.  It was as early as 1830 that Whitney first became enthralled with railroads and foresaw their future role in business and transport.  He believed there was considerable potential with trade with China, and that railroads to the Pacific Ocean would facilitate this commerce.  Whitney's proposed route from Lake Michigan through South Pass to the Pacific was not accepted in part because of the growing sectionalism before the Civil War.  However, the map and report are an important part of the railroad history of the United States.

Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa territories are all enlarged, and a distorted Lake Michigan creates a misshapen Illinois, Michigan and Indiana.  The massive Nebraska Territory stretches from Texas to the Canadian border.  A notation along the boundary between Canada and the U.S. reads, 
Boundary as settled in 1846 Britain retaining the Right to Navigate the Columbia River. 
 Oregon Territory fills the area that would become Washington, Oregon and Idaho.  The new state of California is named as

The southwestern border with Mexico is along the Gila River in a pre-Gadsden Purchase configuration.  The wagon roads to the West are also noted on this detailed map, which according to the note at left was corrected from the maps of Fremont, Emory, Wizlenus and the General Land Office of the State of Texas.

This large, detailed map of the United States extends to include part of Canada and Mexico, although information is focused on the United States.  The map provided an excellent view of the American West with five large territories encompassing almost the entire west, shown to be mostly the domain of numerous Indian nations.  
Minosotah
 Territory takes in the Dakotas with Nebraska Territory stretching to the Rocky Mountains.  Indian Territory encompasses present day Oklahoma, Kansas and parts of Nebraska and Colorado.  West of the Rockies are the state of California and the territories of New Mexico, Utah and Oregon, which encompasses present-day Oregon, Idaho and eastern Washington, with western Washington separately delineated.  The border with Mexico is shown along the Gila River, pre Gadsden Purchase.  The map depicts towns, missions, forts, railroads, and canals, and includes a list of the highest mountain peaks.  A table lists the states and territories, with populations in 1850, number of counties, and size.  Lithography by Handtke.  The map was printed on 4 separate sheets, which are here dissected into 24 sections and backed with linen.  Folds into a brown cloth clam shell case with a printed paper title label.

This huge map was issued just after the Gadsden Purchase and prior to the monumental undertaking of the Pacific Railroad Survey.  It shows the United States with large western territories.  New Mexico and Utah extend to California, while the continental divide marks the borders for Kansas, Nebraska, Washington and Oregon.  Minnesota extends to the Missouri River, and Indian Territory is defined but not named.  Red overprinted lines indicate the customs collection district boundaries and yellow ones distinguish the states and territories.

The map was drawn by David H. Burr, a tremendously important figure in the mapping of the United States.  He began his career surveying in New York in 1829.  He then went on to serve as topographer of the United States Post Office, Geographer for the House of Representatives, surveyor to the states of Florida and Louisiana, Geographer to the U.S. Senate and finally as Surveyor General of Utah Territory during the legal and jurisdictional disputes between Mormon leaders and the U.S. government.

This outstanding map of the United States illustrates early western territorial development with only seven large territories covering the region now making up sixteen states.  Indian Territory extends through Oklahoma, Kansas, and parts of Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming.  To the north of Indian Territory are Minnesota Territory and 
Missouri or Northwest Territory
.  Washington and Oregon are separate territories, both extending east to the Rocky Mountains at the Continental Divide.  Utah Territory encompasses Nevada, and New Mexico Territory encompasses Arizona and parts of Colorado and southern tip of Nevada.  A large area in the southern portion of today's Nevada is 
Unexplored Region
.  The map is filled with forts, Indian tribes, emigrant roads, early railways, mines, battlefields, salt ponds and a host of other interesting details.  Several exploration routes are shown, including those of Fremont, Marcy, and Kearney.  Fremont Basin in Utah Territory is bounded by great dividing ridges separating 
the waters of the Pacific Ocean and the waters of the Great Basin
.  In the lower corners of the map are insets of the Gold Region of California and the District of Columbia.


The United States map (one of only three double-page maps in this atlas issue) is attributed to Cowperthwait, Desilver & Butler in the title and is undated, but the copyright is 1850 by Thomas, Cowperthwait & Co.  This is the first mention in the 
Universal Atlas
 series of Cowperthwait, Desilver & Butler as a publishing entity; it would be later in 1854 when the title credit for the atlas would reflect this change.  This edition bears no page number, unlike the later edition which has a single ""5"" page number in the upper right corner.  This edition includes numerous proposed railroads with an expanded note on railroads adjacent to the legend, as well as a preliminary depiction of the Gadsden Purchase territory, which is shown between New Mexico and 
Graham's Line
.  There is also additional detail in the northwest, including a ""Volanic Region"" in Missouri Territory.

This interesting

 sheet comes from the government's comprehensive atlas covering the War Between the States.  This plate was issued between 1891 and 1895 to accompany the Official Army Records and was published under the Secretaries of War Redfield Proctor, Stephen B. Elkins, and Daniel S. Lamont by Maj. Gen. George B. Davis, assisted by civilian experts Leslie Perry and Joseph Kirkley.  The sheet comes from a series of ten maps tracking changes in boundaries, the position of troops, and the status of Confederate states in six month intervals throughout the course of the war.  This is the sheet depicting the nation as it was on December 31, 1861.  Changes from the previous map in the series, dated June 30, 1861, include sectioning off part of Virginia and Maryland as the Union-controlled Potomac, shrinking the Ohio deparment, and splitting the area previously named 
West
 between Missouri and Kansas departments.

It illustrates the French threat to the British colonies that are confined along the Atlantic seaboard by the Appalachian Mountains.  French trading posts, lead mines, trails, and Indian villages are carefully noted and the Indian nations are prominently named.  The Missouri River emanates from a great lake in the northwest that disappears off the map and another 
Great River
 flows west from 
Lack Pani
; both alluding to the possibility of a passage to the Pacific. 


This is the rare first edition of this map, which appeared in Dr. James Smith's pamphlet,

This is a later edition of Delisle's influential map of the French possession of Louisiana that drew together the cartographic work of the previous half century and had a tremendous impact on the history of cartography.  When originally published in 1718, it was the first detailed map of the Gulf region and the Mississippi, and the first to show the explorations of De Soto, Cavelier, Tonty, Moscoso and Denis.  The map was designed for the political purpose of invalidating the English claims west of the Appalachian Mountains and laid claim to Carolina by the French, which provoked an angry English response.  The name Texas made its first appearance in print on the earlier edition of this map, with the legendary 
Mission de los Teijas
, established in 1716.  The notation of
 Indiens errans et anthrophages
 along the Gulf Coast warns of cannibals.  However, it is the cartography of the Mississippi Valley for which the map is notable today.  An inset of the Mississippi Delta and Mobile Bay fills the lower right corner, titled 
Carte Particuliere des Embouchures de la Riviere S. Louis et de la Mobile
.  This is the Covens & Mortier edition, a re-engraving of the original plate, updated with the addition of New Orleans.

This interesting map first appeared in the journal of Pierre Francois Xavier Charlevoix, a French Jesuit historian and traveler who traveled throughout the French possessions in North America.  The map covers from the Great Lakes through all but the tip of Florida, and from New Mexico and the Rocky Mountains through the eastern seaboard.  The information in the west includes the road from Mexico City to Santa Fe and the routes of St. Denis and De Soto through Texas.  The 
Riviere du Nord
 (Rio Grande) has its headwaters in the upper left corner, only a few miles from the Missouri River.  There is great detail of Indian villages, trading agencies, forts, mines, villages, and colonial settlements.  Bellin based the map on Guillaume Delisle's landmark map of 1718.   While covering the same area, Bellin's map incorporates much new information from Charlevoix and other French explorers, particularly in the depiction of lakes and rivers and additional place names.  Sometimes overlooked because of its similarity to Delisle's map, this map occupies an important step in the cartographic history of North America.

Sagahadok
 is a large region above the barely mentioned 
Main
. Lake Superior is unapologetically filled with fictitious islands.  The region west of the Mississippi River is completely blank with no features, but good detail is provided along its east side including several named Indian villages. It is interesting that the map locates none of the Revolutionary War Bounty Land Grants.  There is good detail east of the Appalachian mountains, but the region between the mountains, the Mississippi River and the Canadian border contain no named regions but it is filled with Indian lands, forts, small towns and villages, and gives good watershed detail.  Curiously, Detroit is not located.  The map just extends to the northern portion of Florida which is divided into east and west regions.  Under the control of Spain, Florida had been ceded by England to the Spanish in gratitude for their neutrality during the American Revolutionary War.  Engraved by Wm. Darton of Tottenham.  Blank verso.

Extremely scarce and very interesting map covering the region from the Great Lakes through Georgia and from the Mid-Atlantic past the Mississippi River.  The map shows early roads, settlements, forts, Indian villages with particular emphasis on the western frontiers in Kentucky and Ohio.  The battle sites and raids against the 
United Tribes in 1791
 are depicted.  Gilbert Imlay, an army officer during the Revolutionary War, emigrated to Kentucky where he worked as a deputy surveyor under George May, at Louisville.  Subsequently he went to Europe where he wrote of his experiences on the then-frontier.  His book, published by J. Debrett, was illustrated with this and three other great early maps, all of which are scarce.

This map is from a French edition of William Bartram's famous narrative 
Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East and West Florida...
, which was first published in 1791.  The volume recounts his odyssey (1773-78) exploring the American Southeast and the plants and wildlife he encountered.  He also describes his contacts with various Indian tribes including the Creek, Cherokee and Choctaw.  The French editions are the only ones to contain the large map of the United States, and it depicts the region from the Mississippi River to the eastern seaboard.  Cartographically, the topography and river systems are particularly well developed with settlement primarily confined to east of the Allegheny Mountains.  Scores of Indian villages are located in the southwestern frontier (present-day Alabama and Mississippi) and Florida, and the entire Northwest Territory is called 
Nouvel Etat de Kentukey
.  Includes seven distance scales.

One of the most interesting and scarce features on early maps of the United States is the appearance of the proposed 
State of Franklin
.  In 1784 settlers in the frontier west of the Appalachian Mountains organized a state government with the state to be named in honor of Benjamin Franklin.  Congress turned down their appeal but the state maintained a legislature and governor until 1788.  This ephemeral state appeared on a small number of maps into the early part of the 19th century.  On this map, and other continental European maps, Franklin is misplaced in the region that is now West Virginia and eastern Kentucky, instead of eastern Tennessee.  Elsewhere on this interesting map, the region north of the Ohio River is labeled Indiana and includes locations of Indian villages and a few early settlements and forts.  Maine extends well into New Brunswick.  This is the first state of the map.  See our June 2015 newsletter article on the State of Franklin

This fascinating map of the Eastern United States and Canada features the short-lived state of 
Franklinia
 in eastern Tennessee (here labeled 
Tennassee
).  In 1785, settlers in present-day western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee organized a state government to be named in honor of Benjamin Franklin.  Congress turned down their appeal but the state maintained a legislature and governor until 1788.  The map also depicts 
Morgania
 in present-day Missouri.  It was named after George Morgan, a land speculator, who attempted to create a new colony in the then Spanish controlled Louisiana Territory near New Madrid (Morgan gave up this endeavor a few years later).  Ohio is not yet named, but the Ohio Company land grant still appears north of the Ohio River.  Florida is divided between East and West.  West of the Appalachians, detail is mostly limited to forts and the locations of numerous Indian tribes. 


The map was issued in the English edition of Francois Andre Michaux's 
Travels to the Westward of the Allegany Mountains...
 and published by Richard Phillips in London.  96 pages.  Octavo, rebound in stiff marbled boards.

This two volume travel guide was written by Christian Schultz.  It describes Schultz's inland journey from New York state to New Orleans via the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, and is notable for giving an accurate and detailed account of this frontier region.  Schultz's book is a compilation of his letters, and was published in direct response to an earlier travel guide written by Englishman Thomas Ashe in 1806.  Ashe had traveled on both of these rivers and wrote mostly negative reports, arousing much bitterness among Americans toward British visitors.  The two volumes are illustrated by 2 plates and 5 folding maps (see images) including: 


Map of the United States Including Louisiana
 (18.6 x 16.4"").  The map extends beyond the Mississippi River to past the 100th meridian.  Depicts a large Mississippi Territory occupying present-day Alabama and Mississippi, and a large Indiana Territory comprised of Wisconsin and eastern Minnesota.  Florida is divided between East & West.  The map locates numerous forts and mines along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.

This small map of the young United States includes several important historical regions.  One of the most unique and scarce features on early maps of the U.S. is the appearance of 
Franklinia
.  In 1785 settlers in present-day western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee organized a state government to be named in honor of Benjamin Franklin.  Congress turned down their appeal but the fledgling state maintained a legislature and governor until 1788.  This ephemeral state appeared on only a small number of maps into the early part of the 19th century.   Another interesting feature is the region labeled 
Indiana
 that appears in what is now West Virginia.  This land was a major contention between the private 
Indiana Land Company
 and the State of Virginia in the latter part of the 18th century.  The argument over ownership of the property resulted in the Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the 
Indiana Land Company
 lost its claim to the land.  Another uncommon regional name is 
New Iberia
, the original Spanish settlement in the region of New Madrid, Missouri.  The large 
Western Territory
 takes up present-day Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio.  A table below the title lists twenty states, territories, and governments (including Franklinia) with their founding dates.  Engraved by B. Smith and published by Hamilton Adams & Co.  This is the second state of the map, dated 1812.  See our June 2015 newsletter article on the State of Franklin

This is the first edition of Melish's 
Travels in the United States of America
 and includes a total of 8 maps (4 folding) between the two volumes.  Melish was the first American publisher to concentrate on cartographic and geographic publications.  Born in Scotland, Melish emigrated to the United States intent on farming.  After traveling some 2,400 miles throughout the northeast looking at land, he finally settled on Philadelphia in 1811.  A year later, he published 
Travels
 which included his very first maps.  He soon came to dominate the industry in this country, and had a huge impact on all subsequent American map-making. 


The frontispiece to volume 1 is Melish's famous 
Map of the United States of America
 (17.4 x 13.0""), which was also likely the first engraved map by H.S. Tanner.  Tanner also had a large impact on mapmaking, becoming one of the finest producers of 19th century maps and atlases.  This map should not be confused with Melish's more common and nearly identical ""United States of America Compiled from the latest & best Authorities"" that was published in several editions between 1818 and 1822.  Tanner's imprint was included in the first edition, but subsequently removed for later editions, making for easy identification.  Cartographically, the map extends west to include both the state of Louisiana and Louisiana Territory.  It provides a good view of the first 300 miles of the Missouri River based on information from the expeditions of Lewis & Clark, Pike, Humboldt and others.  The early territories of Michigan, Illinois, Indiana are noted as well as an unnamed region that takes in the area that would become Wisconsin and Minnesota. A notation of 
Yazoo Speculation
 in the oversized Mississippi Territory refers to the 
Yazoo Land Fraud
 perpetrated in 1789-1796 when the region was part of Georgia.  Includes good detail throughout the states with towns and villages, Indian place names, roads and trails, forts and watershed identified.  Also included in volume one is a folding 
Chart of the Atlantic Ocean
 (10.6 x 8.6"").  Volume two includes folding maps of 
Kentucky
 (13.5 x 7.5"") and 
Ohio
 (9.2 x 9.5"") engraved by John Vallance, and four single page maps showing Pittsburg, the Falls of the Ohio River, Zanesville, and Niagara Falls.  


Octavo, hardbound in full leather with gilt titles on red labels on spine.  Both front free end papers contain the signature of Theodore Gourdin, Washington City,  May 1813.  Gourdin, from South Carolina, served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1813-1815.  The front pastedowns contain the bookplates of the Sondley Reference Library in Asheville, North Carolina.

All of the maps have light to moderate toning, offsetting, and blind library stamps on verso that are nearly invisible on verso.  The large map of the United States has damp stains along the folds and a short repaired binding tear at right.  The map of Kentucky also has a 0.75"" edge tear at top.  Text has moderate toning, foxing, and damp stains at the beginning and end of the volumes.  Externally, the covers are worn and there is some cracking along the joints and spines.

This scarce map, published by John Melish, was issued in William Maclure's report, 
Observations on the Geology of the United States
.  Maclure, known as the ""father of American geology,"" published the first widely available geologic map of the United States in 1809.  And while this is the third issue of the map (1809 in Philadelphia and 1811 in Paris), it is ""generally considered as the starting point for the geology of North America"" (Marcou & Marcou).  The map is color-coded to indicate the location of Primitive Rocks, Transition Rocks, Secondary Rocks, Alluvial Rocks, and Old Red Sand Stone, based on the Wernerian classification system.  Also keyed to the legend is a ""line to the westward of which has been found the greatest part of the Salt & Gypsum.""  The map is filled with information on Indian tribes, forts, roads and early settlements.  Illinois Territory is located well away from Lake Michigan and bounded on the north by the large 
North West Territory
.  Chicago is correctly located, but is on the border between Indiana and North West Territory.  Of particular interest are distance notations along several major roads in miles.  A legend locates canals, boundary lines and roads.  


The map is still bound to the front of the volume and includes an additional folding plate showing five elevation profiles originating in the Appalachian Mountains.  127 pages, hardbound in black quarter leather and tips over marbled boards.


See also lot 110 for Cleaveland's 1822 edition of this geological map.

This early geological map of the United States is bound into the back of volume two of 
An Elementary Treatise...
 by Parker Cleaveland.  The map's geology is by Cleaveland and was drawn by H. Morse.  It extends into Texas to include San Antonio, and uses hand coloring to depict five or six geologic classifications.  Marcou states that this map is a reissue of the 1817 Maclure's Geological Map ""with very few additions or variations"".  In addition to the map, there are five geological plates also bound into the rear of volume two.  Second edition, 796 total pages in two volumes with index and explanation of plates.  Octavo, rebound in tan buckram with red title label on spine.  One of the most famous and widely used mineralogical reference works of the early 19th century in America. 


See also lot 110 for Maclure's 1817 geological map.

The folding map has light scattered foxing, a short binding tear at right, and a 2"" fold separation at lower right that has been repaired on verso with old paper.  The text and additional plates have light toning and occasional scattered foxing.  A previous owner's signature is on the title page of volume one.  Modern binding is excellent with slightly bumped edges.

This small map of the young United States includes several important historical regions.  One of the most unique and scarce features on early maps of the United States is the appearance of 
Franklinia
.  In 1785 settlers in present-day western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee organized a state government to be named in honor of Benjamin Franklin.  Congress turned down their appeal but the fledgling state maintained a legislature and governor until 1788. This ephemeral state appeared on only a small number of maps into the early part of the 19th century, this being a late example.  Another interesting feature is the region labeled Indiana that takes up what is now West Virginia.  This land was a major contention between the private Indiana Land Company and the State of Virginia in the latter part of the 18th century. The argument over ownership of the property resulted in the Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Indiana Land Company lost its claim to the land.  Several other interesting place names include the Heckerton Settlement, many early forts, Indian villages, and the location of the winter camps for Lewis & Clark in 1803/04 and Lieut. Pike's two years later.  The large Western Territory takes up present-day Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.  The large Louisiana is further west.  Published by John Thomson in Edinburgh.

The uncolored area at the left is labeled 
Messicana

The primary emphasis is on the Ohio & Mississippi Railway which is shown running from Cincinnati to St. Louis (321 miles).  A table at lower right indicates distances from Cincinnati to various destinations.  Lithographed by Klaupreck & Menzel.  Printed on two sheets and joined.   While this map was dated 1851, the Ohio and Mississippi Railway actually began service in 1857.  In 1893 it was merged with the Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern Railway, and is now part of CSX.  Not found in Modelski or Phillips.

This map of the United States give great detail of the states in the eastern half of the country, with particular emphasis on the railroads, both completed and proposed.  Arkansas and Missouri have outdated shapes circa 1835, despite the fact that this map was published almost 20 years later.  The territories to the west are named but not outlined, including a large Nebraska Territory that extends from Kansas to the Canadian border.  A large inset at left shows the far western portion of the US, including California with the Gold Region marked by use of color, and large Washington, Oregon, and Utah territories.  New Mexico is squeezed to the east of the Rocky Mountains (here called 
Sierra Madre
) and the area of Arizona is left unnamed and nearly devoid of information.  Another small inset in the Atlantic shows the southern portion of Florida.  This map was published in Henry Teesdale's atlas circa 1854.

This important map, first issued in 1635, is one of the first to focus on the Dutch colony in North America and to name 
Nieu Amsterdam
 (New York).  It is based on the manuscript of Andriaen Block (1614), a Dutch fur trader, who explored the area between Cape Cod and Manhattan and was the first to correctly delineate the longitudinal scale of the coastline and establish Manhattan as an island.  The colony of 
Nieu Pleimonth
 is identified, as well as other English names along the coast, which were derived from Smith's map of New England in 1616.  The map is oriented with north to the right and is richly adorned with a variety of wildlife, including the first appearance of beavers, polecats and otters on a printed map.  Quebec is noted with a minute depiction of the fort and buildings, and the mythical kingdom pf 
Norumbega
 is noted near the
 R. Pentagouet 
 (Penobscot River) in present-day Maine.  A large Mohawk village is shown derived from the White-de Bry engravings.  It is further embellished with a large title cartouche flanked by two natives, sailing ships, canoes, and compass roses.  Latin text on verso, published between 1640-55.

Original color on watermarked paper with minor foxing and faint show through of text on verso.  Two damp stains are confined to the left and right blank margins, well away from map.  Very nearly in ""A"" condition.

The mapping of the trans-Allegheny and Great Lakes regions and in the interior of New England is of particular interest, for this shows some of the earliest accurate information of these regions incorporating data from the Mitchell, Evans and Fry-Jefferson maps.  Also of great interest is the region known as the Forks of the Ohio (confluence of the Allegheny and Monomgahela rivers) and the location of French Fort Duquesne  the region hotly disputed during the French and Indian War.  It is embellished with a large title cartouche engraved by Marie Catherine Haussard.  This is the first state of the map, with ""Louisiane"" in the western frontier and borders that predate the 1763 Treaty of Paris.  It was published in 1757 as part of the first edition.

This map, issued during the 
Revolutionary War
 era, is one of the most detailed maps of the province of New York by a British military engineer.  The map was created by actual surveys by John Montresor, who was trained by his father, an engineer in the British royal army.  Montresor joined the 48th Regiment and served under General Braddock during the failed campaign against Fort Duquesne in 1756.  In 1765 Montresor was commissioned by General Thomas Gage to compile a map of New York City in anticipation of unrest at the close of the French and Indian War.  Shortly thereafter, Montresor returned to England with several draft maps of New York and the surrounding areas, and proceeded to work with the firm of John Rocque for engraving and printing.  Although his map of New York City (
A Plan of the City of New-York & its Environs
) was published in 1767, Montresor's map of the province did not appear until 1775.  His map of New York and the surrounding provinces was critical at the outbreak of the American Revolution for providing good information on the colonies for strategic and military planning.


The map covers the area from the Connecticut River west to the Hudson River and Mohawk Valley, and from Long Island north to Lake Champlain.  The map shows counties, churches, forts, manors, roads and the names of some residents among its amazing details.  The southwest sheet gives special attention to the boundary line between New York and New Jersey, which had been under contention since the Duke of York had granted New Jersey to Sir George Carteret and John, Lord Berkeley in 1664.  Three different locations for the boundary line are indicated on Montresor's map, labeled as the ""division line of 1719,"" the line ""in favor of the Crown of the Province of New York,"" and the ""more reputed jurisdiction line  for upwards of 50 years past.""  The boundary line was finally settled in 1764 and surveyed by Bernard Ratzer in 1769.  Although Montresor was apparently aware of the official boundary line as evidenced by his own journals, he did not add the line to this map.  The northwest sheet shows extensive detail of the river systems, lakes and topography in the region, with Lake Champlain depicted in a large inset.  Both northern sheets are filled with miniature trees, symbolizing the vast forested areas.  Montresor's map was also one of the first to show good detail of present-day Vermont, and included an inset on the northeast sheet showing the continuation of the Connecticut River into northern Vermont, noting the 
White Hills
.  


The map is dedicated to Sir Jeffrey Amherst, a general in the British Army and royal governor of Virginia from 1759 until 1768.  Engraved by P. Andrews and published by Andrew Dury.  This is the third state of four, with 
Ticonderoga or Fort Carillon
 located on the west bank.  On four sheets, professionally joined.

Overall very clean and bright, with some faint toning and staining along the top and bottom border.  There are expert and nearly invisible repairs to a 24"" edge tear at lower right, a 5"" edge tear at left, and a 2"" tear near the middle of the map where the sheets were joined.

This graphic map is Henricus Hondius' version of Capt. John Smith's important map of 1612, drawn from his brother's map of 1618.  After the death of Jodocus Hondius in 1629, his widow sold a number of plates to Blaeu.  Angry at the sale to a competitor, Henricus and Joannes Jansson engaged engravers to cut new plates, which were largely based on Jodocus' work.  This is the 5th derivative of Smith's map.  It is beautifully engraved with topographical features and the locations of scores of Indian villages.  In the upper left corner is an engraving of the great Indian chief Powhatan seated on his throne and surrounded by his subjects.  A Susquehanna chief, facing in toward Chesapeake Bay (opposite of Jodocus' plate), is depicted on the right under a coat of arms.  Latin text on verso, published between 1636-1644.

This large, attractive map was published in Tanner's first edition 
American Atlas
, which is considered one of the finest American atlases ever published.  The map exhibits very fine detail throughout including battlegrounds, public houses, towns and villages, mills, iron works, topography, and much more.  It also shows distances from various locations to the state capitals of Harrisburg and Trenton.  County development is current to 1822 with the addition of Clearfield in Pennsylvania.  The map pre-dates the formation of Warren County in New Jersey.  Two distance scales show American and Geographical Miles. 


Henry Schenck Tanner was one of the most productive and successful cartographic publishers of the early nineteenth century, a period known as the golden age of American cartography. The large, beautifully engraved maps from this atlas were considered among the ""most splendid works of the kind ever executed in this country,"" as reported in the United States Gazette (Philadelphia) in 1823.

This stunning map was compiled from two of the most important source maps of the early colonial period: John White's Virginia and Jacques le Moyne's Florida.  Hondius' map became the prototype map of the region for the first half of the 17th century and continued to influence the cartography of the region until the middle of the 18th century.  Largely due to the enormous success of Hondius' 
Atlas
, Le Moyne's erroneous depiction of a large inland lake (
Lacus aquae dulcis
) from which the 
R. de May
 (St. John's River) flows in a southeasterly direction was popularized.  Chesapeake Bay, here called 
Chesepioock Sinus
, and the area south towards 
C.S. Romano Hispanis
 are shown in their White delineations.  The Indian villages of 
Paquiwok, Croatoan
, and 
Wococon
 are named in the Outer Banks and several others along the Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds.  The map is extensively decorated with depictions of Indian villages incorporated in the title cartouche, a Floridian king and queen and Virginian natives in a canoe taken from De Bry, wildlife including a wild turkey, ships, sea monsters and a superb compass rose.  French text on verso, published between 1613-1616.

This striking map of the Southeast region was based on the landmark
 Lords Proprietor's Map
 of 1672 by Ogilby/Moxon.  It incorporates information from a number of early accounts including Lederer, Hilton, Sandford, Ashley-Cooper and Culpeper.  Oriented with north to the right as indicated by the compass rose, the map covers the region from St. Augustine to Cape Charles and Jamestown with detail focused along several rivers.  The fictitious 
Ashley Lake
, 
Deserta Arenosa
 and a 
Savana
 east of the 
Apalathean Mountains
 are of particular interest.  It is artistically embellished with graphic mountain ranges, a title cartouche, the arms of Charles II and ships.  English text on verso contains an interesting account of John Lederer's important explorations.  Speed's atlas was the first world atlas produced wholly in England.

This is the southeastern sheet of D'Anville's four-sheet map of Eastern North America.  It covers the region from west of the Mississippi River at Natchitoches to the east coast from St. Augustine north to Wilmington, Delaware.  The map provides an excellent depiction of the river systems and topography, and locates numerous Indian tribes and place names along the coast. 


The complete map was based in part on Mitchell's famous map of the United States which appeared earlier in the same year.  D'Anville developed his version of the map with an emphasis on French influence on the area, omitting Mitchell's legend, references to English factories in the disputed trans-Allegheny area, and drew on French sources for additional details over the Mitchell map.

This is the first Irish edition (third overall) of this famous narrative by the American naturalist William Bartram.  Based upon his travels between 1773-78, the narrative recounts his four year odyssey exploring the American Southeast and the plants and wildlife he encountered.  Bartram also describes his contacts with various Indian tribes including the Creek, Cherokee and Choctaw.  Sabin describes it as ""unequalled [sic.] for its vivid picturesqueness of its descriptions of nature, scenery, and productions.""  Included with the text is a frontispiece portrait of Mico Chlucco, 7 engraved illustrations of plants and animals, and a small map entitled 
A Map of the Coast of East Florida, from the River St. John, Southward to near Cape Canaveral
 (6.0 x 9.5"").  The map covers the coast of northeastern Florida and was based on the survey of East and West Florida by Bernard Romans and George Gauld in 1771-1772.  It is one of the few detailed maps of this region that was published in the early Spanish Period.

Most of the information is derived from the Spanish explorations of Hernando de Soto, Cabeza de Vaca, and Moscoso.  It is largely based on the Ortelius/Chaves map of 1584, but expanded to include parts of Cuba and the Bahamas and further north to show the territory of the legendary

This miniature map of the Spanish possessions in North America covers the region south of the Great Lakes (
Lac Erie
) to the Gulf of Mexico and Florida.  It is drawn from Nicolas Sanson's influential map (
La Floride
) of 1657.  It differs from the folio map in the prominence given to the 
Rio del Spiritu S.
to
 over the other rivers flowing into the 
Mar Pequeno
.  
Caroline
 (the old French Ft. Caroline) is located approximately at Port Royal in the region claimed by the French (
Floride Francoise
).


Pierre Duval was Nicolas Sanson's nephew and pupil.  He published a wide range of atlases and individual maps including a fine miniature world geography with many of the maps based on Sanson.  This map is from the German edition of Duval's world geography.  New maps were engraved by Sigismund G. Hipschman (as his signature appears on the title page and the world map) and have Latin titles rather than the original French.  The maps are often attributed to Johann C. Beer, who translated the work into German.  This is the second state with the page number ""85"" engraved at top right.

This influential map shows the Spanish and French possessions in the southern part of the United States.  The map extends from the southernmost part of Virginia to the coast of what is now Texas.  When first introduced by Sanson in 1657, this map was the first to use the name 
L. Erie
 in an atlas and to introduce several new rivers in Virginia.  The French claims in the Carolinas are reasserted with the region named 
Floride Francoise
, despite the region not having had any French presence for nearly 100 years.  The place name 
Caroline
 is not related to the future English colony of Carolina.  Instead it is a confusion between the French Fort Caroline on the St. Johns River, and Charlefort that was located near Port Royal.  This is the first state as defined by Burden.

This interesting map focuses on the French explorations in the Mississippi Valley and the Gulf Coast, and is the fist to incorporate the Spanish discoveries in the region.  Here, De Fer highlights information gleaned from the expeditions of La Salle and Iberville with the primary purpose of showing the progress of French exploration in the region.  La Salle had explored the Mississippi from the north in 1682-83 and returned by sea to establish a French colony in 1685.  He missed the Mississippi delta and landed on the Texas coast, an error probably due to his inability to calculate longitude and because prominent maps of the period placed the mouth of the river far to the west of its true location.  In 1686, Spanish pilot Juan Enriquez Barroto set off in search of La Salle's colony and made detailed records of estuaries and landmarks along the Gulf Coast.  Although his map is lost, it was copied on a manuscript chart by Juan Bisente, who was captured by the French in 1697 along with his map.  As a result, De Fer was able to include the new and more accurate Spanish information on his map, in particular the southeastward trending lower course of the Mississippi River, which had been incorrectly depicted on previous maps.  The map also shows the basically correct relationship of the Mississippi River to Lake Pontchartrain and the Gulf of Mexico.  The site of La Salle's ill-fated colony near Matagorda Bay in modern-day Texas is shown and the title cartouche also dramatizes the explorer's tragic death at the hands of his own men.  Engraved by Vincent de Ginville.  As a result of combining both French and Spanish explorations, De Fer was able to produce the most accurate map of the region for its time.  The map was first published in 1701, and then reissued in De Fer's 
Atlas Curieux
 in 1705.  This landmark map was used as the cover illustration for The Historic New Orleans Collection's excellent reference work, 
Charting Louisiana

This scarce map is one of the earliest published maps of the English colony of Georgia.  It is a somewhat larger example that was apparently taken from the 1733 map in Martyn's 
Reasons for Establishing The Colony of Georgia
, although with numerous errors and omissions.  This map has also been attributed to James Oglethorpe, founder of the British Georgia colony in 1732, and presents extensive English claims southward to just north of St. Augustine, no doubt inflaming Spanish interests at the time.  This hostility led to the War of Jenkins Ear in 1739.  The map covers the region from Florida and up the east coast extending north to above the Cartuck River at the northern border of South Carolina.  It extends west to beyond the Mississippi River, showing all of colonial South Carolina, Georgia and Florida.  The southern portion of Florida is composed of numerous islands.  A southerly bloated coast along the Florida panhandle suggests vast lands that could be utilized by farmers under the Oglethorpe Plan for colonization.  Coincidentally, the lands end at the line demarcating The South Bounds of Carolina.  Few settlements are identified, with the exception of 
Charles Town
, 
Port Royall
, St. Augustine and a few others, and the prime meridian is drawn at Charleston.  This map also includes notations related to the number of men in various Indian tribes: Illinois 500 men, Weachthenoes 500 men, Okesee Nation 700 men.  A fascinating map that was clearly constructed to promote the Georgia colonization efforts.

James Adair was a frontiersman and fur trader who spent forty years living and interacting with Native American Indians in the Southeast.  He was one of the first white settlers to explore the Alleghenies, and spent much of his time with the Cherokee, Catawba and Chickasaw tribes.  His work outlines his first-hand information on their religion, customs, beliefs, ceremonies, and language.  Although Adair includes a chapter outlining the similarities between Jews and the Native Americans, arguing that the Natives descended from the Jewish people, the majority of his work is filled with astute and valuable observations on Indians.  Howes considers Adair's work the ""best 18th century English source on the Southern tribes.""  The frontispieces to Adair's work is a map engraved by John Lodge, 
A Map of the American Indian Nations, Adjoining to the Missisippi, West & East Florida, Georgia, S. & N. Carolina, Virginia, &c.
, depicting the southern United States extending north to Lake Michigan and Lake Erie, and west just past the Mississippi River.  The map shows the locations of numerous Indian tribes, both common ones such as the Creek and Cherokee, as well as lesser known tribes, such as Ishtahoe and Kow-he-tah.  The states are named with the boundaries of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia extending west to the Mississippi River.  Also of note are several early forts that are identified, including Fort Moore, Fort Conde, Fort Tumbikbe and Fort Toulouse.

The map is lightly toned with moderate offsetting and scattered foxing (B).  The text has light toning and scattered foxing (B+).  The new covers and spine show very light wear (A).

Two important 
Revolutionary War
 period sea charts issued by the Depot de la Marine on an elephant folio sheet.  These maps were prepared by the French Navy under Antoine Sartine, Minister of Marine, upon their entry in to the war on the American side.  First is an elegant rendering of part of the Gulf Coast covering the region between St. Joseph Bay and Vermilion Bay.  Numerous rivers, bays, islands and lakes are identified, as are the towns/forts of Pensacola, Mobile, Biloxi and New Orleans.  The ruins of Fort la Boulaye, established in 1700 as the first French outpost, are shown (incorrectly) on the west bank of the Mississippi River below New Orleans.  The second map covers the Florida Peninsula from St. Mary's River to St. Joseph Bay and south to the Everglades.  It extends to include the Bahama Channel, the Bahamas, the Florida Keys and the northern coast of Cuba.  Rhumb lines and coastal soundings further graphically enhance these attractive charts.  Each chart has its own borders and they could be separated for framing as they are oriented opposite of one another on the sheet.  They are generally not sold together. 


The plans are remarkable for the amount of interior detail provided in light of their intended marine use.

This fine map is a fascinating historical document of the United States following the Revolutionary War.  It includes an early reference to the 
New State of Franklin
 in western North Carolina.  The map includes a great amount of information including boundaries claimed by the various Indian Nations and trading paths on the western frontier.  It shows early settlements, including a 
Moravian Settlement
 in North Carolina, and the 
Cumberland Settlements
 in present-day Tennessee.   At the top of the map, in the nascent Northwest Territory, the 
7 Ranges
 denote the first application of the Public Land Survey System.  Several bounty land grants are shown including the Ohio Company, Wabash Company, New Jersey Company, Illinois Company, and the Donation Lands of the Commonwealth of Virginia.  A triangular shaped plot of land in the region of present-day West Virginia is labeled 
Indiana
.  Included with the map is the title page from Morse's 
The American Geography
 as well as the front free-endpaper with the signature of Montgomery Hamilton from Fort Wayne, Indiana. 


In 1785, settlers in present-day western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee organized a state government to be named in honor of Benjamin Franklin, 
Franklin or Frankland
.  Congress turned down their appeal but the state maintained a legislature and governor until 1788.  This ephemeral state appeared on a small number of maps into the early part of the 19th century. 


The Revolutionary government of the United States used 
bounty land grants
 in their struggle for independence from Great Britain.  The free lands exchanged for military service provided an effective technique for enrolling support for the war and encouraging re-enlistments.  Generally the bounty lands were located on the western frontier, which provided another benefit to the government.  Populating the frontier with citizens skilled in defense offered the best prospect in enticing other settlers to join them, thus eventually increasing the tax rolls. 


The region shown on this map as 
Indiana
 was originally granted to a Philadelphia trading company by the Iroquois Confederacy in 1768.  Then in 1776 it  was sold to the 
Indiana Land Company
, but was also claimed by the State of Virginia as a part of her original charter.  The resulting battle between the private land company and Virginia resulted in the Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and is one of the most interesting chapters in the history of the young United States.

This is the second edition of this important map that was first published in 1776 in a British military atlas.  In this edition the title has been revised to acknowledge the United States.  The map is based on the work of De Brahm, Collet, Mouzon and the important hydrographical surveys of the coast of Florida and the Bahamas by Bernard Romans.  It includes inset plans of St. Augustine and Charleston above the decorative title cartouche.  The map is most noteworthy for its depiction of East and West Florida.  The coastline of the Florida peninsula is accurately depicted but the interior remains virtually unknown with a spine of mountains, labeled 
the Great Sandy Ridge
,  extending down the center of the peninsula.  The map is filled with information concerning the Indian Nations, with numerous trails, roads and villages located.

Handsome early map covering from South Carolina to Florida and the Bahamas and much of the lower Mississippi valley.  The map depicts Florida and southern Louisiana during the period it was controlled by the Spanish.  There are no engraved political divisions indicating the mapmaker's bias toward the territorial claims of either Spain or the United States.  In Georgia, settlement is confined to east of the mountains, while a large number of Indian villages and a few French forts are shown on the western frontier.  The map provides an excellent view of the Gulf Coast with a dramatically oversized Tampa Bay (Baie de St. Esprit), reflecting the limits of contemporary knowledge of the region.  Numerous Indian villages are located and roads are shown connecting early settlements.  In central Florida the southern-most settlements are 
Dest

Suliga
 and

This is a wonderful map of the Southeast issued during a period of rapid change and advancement.   East and West Florida exist as separate territories.  West Florida was not annexed into the United States until 1810.  Portions of it became Louisiana, Alabama and Florida.  The map is filled with information on the roads, portages, forts, Indian villages, settlements and topography.  It is also remarkable for the many interesting notes, including the 
Principal Hunting Grounds of the Western Party and Six Villages
 in Mississippi, here shown as part of the large Georgia Territory.  In Florida, 
Fort St. Marks, Apalacha Fort

This uncommon early map of Mississippi Territory covers the region of present-day Mississippi and Alabama.  This is the first separately published map of the Mississippi Territory to show the annexation of the Mobile District of West Florida, which occurred on May 14, 1812.  This gave the entire southern portion of the US unfettered access to Gulf of Mexico shipping.  At the extreme northwest corner of the map is Fort Pickering, near the future site of Memphis.  Numerous Indian tribes and villages are located along with a few early settlements and forts.  There is fine detail of the region's watershed.  New Orleans, Mobile, and Pensacola are identified.

This map provides a detailed view of the forks of the Missouri and Ohio Rivers along the Mississippi and adjacent areas.  While the map is filled with Indian villages, it shows very little European settlement other than a couple of French forts and Dr. Thomas Walker's settlement.  Dr. Walker, surveyor for the Ohio and Loyal Land Companies, led a small group into the area in 1750 and established a supply post in the area of present-day Barbourville, Kentucky.  This is one sheet of Zatta's version of John Mitchell's epic map.  The whole map, titled ""Le Colonie Unite dell' America Settentrle,"" was published as a set of twelve individual maps.  Each sheet stands on its own and has full borders. 


In the January 1999 issue on MapForum.com, Ashley Baynton-Williams discussed and listed the earliest maps to reflect the use of the name ""Untied States"" on a map.  He concluded that ""the first printed map devoted to the thirteen states, and to use a name distinguishing them from their previous status of British Colonies was published neither by an Englishman, Frenchman, or American, but by an Italian, Antonio Zatta.  His map 
Le Colonie Unite Dell' America Settentr.le...
 was published in 1778, in his 
Storia Dell' America Settentrional
, and then re-issued in the 
Atlante Novissimo
 (1778-1785).  While (in relative terms) a common map, I do not know that anyone has previously remarked on the significant of the title.""

This scarce little map depicts the French possessions in the Mississippi River valley.  The map is largely based on Hennepin with enlarged Great Lakes and the Mississippi located too far to the west of its true course.  Numerous forts, proposed colonial settlements, and Indian villages are located as well as 
Mines de St. Barbe
.  The map is decorated with a title cartouche incorporating the arms of John Law and a crest showing two Native Americans holding a large golden horn of plenty from which the Mississippi flows. 


This map was most likely engraved by Leonard Schenk.  It accompanied a satirical account of the collapse of the French Compagnie de la Louisiane d'Occident, known as the 
Mississippi Bubble
 incident, and one of the most infamous financial meltdowns in history.  John Law, a Scottish financier, established the company in 1717 and was granted control of Louisiana.   Law developed an elaborate plan to exploit the fabulous resources of the region, which quickly gained popularity and people rushed to invest.  Share prices opened at 500 livres and rapidly rose to 18,000 livres.  At this point the 
bubble
 burst; speculators cashed in, caused a run on the shares, and the company went bankrupt.  As a consequence of the failure, confidence in other similar companies failed, and thousands of individual investors across Europe were ruined.

This is the first French edition of this important report covering the first United States government expedition to the Southwest, depicting Pike's journey from 1805-1807.  The French edition is translated by M. Breton from the 1811 English edition, which was substantially improved and revised over the 1810 American edition.  Pike's book is one of the most important of all American travel narratives, and stands alongside those of Lewis and Clark as a cornerstone of early western exploration.  Included are accounts of Pike's travels to find the headwaters of the Arkansas and Red Rivers, his explorations along the Mississippi River, and his Spanish escort to Santa Fe, New Mexico and Chihuahua, Mexico.  The three folding maps included at the back of the volume have been corrected and improved over earlier editions and printed on heavy paper.  The maps include: 


Premiere Partie de la Carte de l'Interieur de la Louisiane
 (17.8 x 17.3"") [and] 
Carte de l'Interieur de la Louisiane, Comprenant tous les Pays jusqu'alors inconnus...
 (15.1 x 17.1"").  These two sheets, each with their own borders, depict Pike's journey to the headwaters of the Arkansas and Red Rivers.  The maps cover the region from the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers west to the Rio Grande and north to above 
Highest Peak
 (later to be named Pikes Peak).  They depict the path of the American Exploring Expedition to the Rocky Mountains as well as the route of the pursuing Spaniards.  A legend at bottom left identifies American camps, Spanish camps, villages and survey work (western sheet).  The maps are filled with numerous notations in French including ""Source of the Red River of the Mississippi,"" and ""Innumerable Herds of Buffaloes &c...""  Wheat notes that these two maps were ""the first maps of this entire region to display knowledge derived from actual explorations"" and were ""milestones in the mapping of the American West."" 


Carte du Mississippi, Depuis sa Source jusqu'a l'Embouchure du Missouri
 (29.5 x 9.0"").  This long map follows the course of the Mississippi River from the Missouri River to its source and farther north to Lake Winnipeg.  Includes numerous notations describing features of the river, locates scores of Indian villages, and shows the winter quarters of Pike, Potier and Dickson. 


Octavo, 2 volumes bound in one (368 pages and 373 pages).  Hardbound in quarter leather over marbled boards with gilt titling on spine.  Published by D'Hautel in Paris.

This early American map focuses on what was then the western frontier.   It shows the new territories that had been created from the original 
Northwestern Territory of the River Ohio
 - Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois and the remainder of Northwest Territory (Wisconsin and Minnesota).  It shows Chicago in the Northwestern Territory, as the northern Illinois border is shown south of the present-day boundary without touching Lake Michigan.  The spurious

 still persists in Lake Superior.  There is excellent detail of the Mississippi River and above to the Lake of the Woods.  Detroit is shown with its Canadian neighbor, Windsor, named

Reflecting Stephen H. Long's exploratory expedition, this is an important map of the early western territories.  The Long expedition ranks with the expeditions of Lewis & Clark and Zebulon Pike in important explorations of the Trans-Mississippi West.  Among other important aspects of the map are the depictions of the major rivers crossing the plains.  The map extends to the headwaters of the Missouri in the north and to Santa Fe in the south.  The plains are labeled 
Grand Desert,
 a term coined by Long.  Numerous Indian villages are shown, based on information gained from the Lewis and Clark expedition, along with additional important exploration routes.  The map shows a large Arkansas Territory extending to include present-day Oklahoma and an early Missouri western border.  The western portions of the map are identical to Long's map of 1823, also published by Carey & Lea.  French text surrounds the map on three sides of the large folio sheet (24.1 x 18.0"").  The second title listed is in the upper margin above the neatline.  The map was originally engraved by Young & Delleker in 1822, and published by Carey and Lea.  This is their French version published by Buchon which was issued on finer paper and usually found in much finer condition than his American counterparts.

These two maps depict the Congressional debate over the nature of the Frontier Defenses between the Mississippi River and the Rocky Mountains, illustrating the proposals of J.R. Poinsett and Charles Gratiot.  Both maps depict the states of Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Indian nations bordering them to the west.  Military forts and outposts from Ft. Jessup to Ft. Snelling are designated, and notations identify the lands ceded by several Indian nations with dates of the treaties. The threat posed by hostile Indians, whose numbers greatly exceeded those of the settlers in the area, resulted in a protracted Congressional debate concerning the defenses required along the frontier.  Poinsett's plan is the least detailed.  Gratiots plan uses color to trace the common roads and rivers and adds a table showing distances between forts and ""days of march"" at 15 miles per day.  

Both sheets are issued folding.  The Gratiot has light scattered foxing and the Poinsett has minor toning and a few spots of foxing.

This is a scarce map of Central US showing early county configurations and territorial boundaries.  The map extends from northern Texas to the border between the US and Canada.  Nebraska and Kansas show county development only in the far eastern portion of the state, and New Mexico and Colorado show very early county lines.  Indian Territory is divided into 3 large reservations, with a number of different tribes noted.  Dakota Territory is shown in an odd configuration encompassing part of present-day Wyoming.  Montana is not named here.  This part of the United States saw rapid growth during this time, as evidenced by the extensions of the Pony Express and US Mail routes, proposed wagon roads, and the proposed route of the Pacific Railroad.  The ""Great Route to California and Oregon via South Pass"" is marked from Omaha to beyond Fort Laramie.  Forts are identified with miniature American flags, and the paths of various explorers are also noted, including Fremont, Emory, Peck, and Whipple, among others.  This is a scarce issue that only appeared between 1864-66.

This map is the 
rare first state
 of Desilver's map showcasing the new Kansas and Nebraska territories.  It is from the first atlas containing the map issued in late 1855, where it was found between map numbers 37 and 38, but not yet referenced in the table of contents.  In 1857, the map was replaced with a revised edition that has a more pronounced bulge in the western boundary of Nebraska Territory and is enclosed in the new  Desilver-style scroll border.  When Desilver took over the publication of Mitchell's atlas in late 1855, he realized that the atlas was missing a map showing the new territories of Kansas and Nebraska.  There was considerable public interest in these territories that had been created by the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 due to the politics involved.  The act repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820, and allowed settlers in those territories to determine if they would allow slavery within their boundaries.  Nebraska Territory stretches between Kansas and the border with Canada, and from the continental divide to the early Minnesota Territory at the Missouri River.  Kansas stretches west to include South Park in present-day Colorado.  New Mexico Territory is shown in its largest configuration, including present-day Arizona and portions of southern Colorado, with early coloration of the counties on this issue.  Oklahoma has its correct boundaries but is Indian Territory.  Interesting features and notations include several emigrant and exploration routes in the region, the 
Great Indian Treaty Ground
 in Nebraska, and an 
Uninhabited Region
 in Arizona.  The 
Road from Ft. Smith to Santa Fe 900 miles made by order of Gen. Arbuckle
"" and another 
Road from Ft. Smith to Dona Ana 820 miles made by order of Gen. Arbuckle
 refer to routes to the gold mines in California.  Another unique feature of this map is one that appears to be a coloring error; the region west of Nebraska shows Washington Territory extending into Canada reflecting U.S. claims to the region that had been resolved in 1846.  Desilver's Philadelphia imprint is below the title, and the old copyright date of 1850 appears below the neatline.

This is David Dale Owen's important report on the first geological reconnaissance of approximately 11,000 square miles of mostly Wisconsin and Iowa territories, along with the northern portion of the state of Illinois.  Owen was hired by the U.S. government to survey this large region for valuable minerals before they began opening lands for public sale.  He was the first to identify the vast resources of the region, and his surveys were the basis for James Hall's 1843 
Geological Map of the Middle and Western States
.  The report contains a total of 4 folding maps and 24 other illustrations (many folding) including several geological sections, views, and fossil plates.  Of particular importance is the large 
Geological Chart of Part of Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois
 (21.8 x 26.5""), which highlights the lead region in red and identifies numerous lead mines, copper ore and iron ore.  Other folding maps of interest are 
Geological Section from the Mouth of Rock River through the Blue Mounds to the Wisconsin River...

Chart of the Great Illinois Coal Field
 (8.4 x 7.7"").  First edition (a subsequent Senate edition was published in 1844), disbound, 161 pages with 28 total plates.  Scarce issue.

Maps are very good with very light toning, occasional offsetting, and a few spots of foxing.  The plates were printed on two different types of paper; those on thicker paper are clean and bright with an occasional spot of foxing (A); those on thinner paper have light toning with scattered foxing (B+).

 (dated 1835, 29.6 x 19.6""), covers the point where the Galien River meets Lake Michigan at New Buffalo.  The waters of both the river and the lake are filled with soundings, and New Buffalo is shown in plan form.  Surveyed by Liets. J. M. Berrien and E. Rose and drawn by Berrien.  The others maps,

 (14.0 x 10.8"") and 
Map of a Part of the South Shore of Lake Erie in the Vicinity of the Twenty Mile Creek Pennsylvania
 (dated 1830, 15.3 x 10.9""), first appeared in a report in 1834.  They focus on tributaries of Lake Erie and include soundings.  The Elk Creek map was copied by Lt. Col. & Topographical Engineer James Kearny.  The Twentymile Creek map (not to be confused with the Twenty Mile Creek in Ontario) features details of a proposed pier and was surveyed and executed by Thomas Forster and James Maurice Jr. 

The maps are clean, bright, and nearly flawless.  Disbound text has minor scattered foxing.

This uncommon map first appeared in Carey's 
American Pocket Atlas
 in 1805, just two years after the Louisiana Purchase.  It shows the entire region west of the Mississippi River with the boundary line demarcating the southwest (labeled 
New Mexico
) extending just to the north of the North Fork River.  The map focuses on the river and mountain systems in the West, with only a few cities noted, including New Orleans, Santa Fe, and St. Louis.  The locations of Indian tribes are marked with small triangles.  A 
Grand Portage
 is shown between Lake Superior and Lake of the Woods, and a series of lakes and rivers continues the navigable route nearly to the Pacific Ocean.  The Missouri River winds its way throughout the west, nearly reaching the Pacific Ocean in present-day Oregon.  Many of the rivers and mountains are spurious, as the map was published while Lewis & Clark's expedition was still underway.


This map was subsequently published in Carey's 
American Atlas
 in 1809 and his 
General Atlas
 in 1811.  The map was re-engraved for the 1814 edition of the 
General Atlas
 with a new title: 
Missouri Territory. Formerly Louisiana
.  This edition, published in the 1811 
General Atlas
, is unique for its extremely wide blank margins, which were required to fit it into the folio atlas.  The 1811 edition of the 
General Atlas
 is known to be one of the scarcest editions.

A nice impression with very light toning, a few spots of foxing, and a minor crease at bottom right.  The map has exceptionally wide margins.

This is the second American edition of an unauthorized account of Lewis & Clark's expedition to the Pacific Ocean.  This spurious account was published due to strong public interest in the topic coupled with the fact that the authorized version had not yet been released (1814).  Given the limited information on the actual journey (Patrick Gass, Sergeant of the Corps of Discovery, had published his account in 1807), the author was reliant on information in the public domain and ""partly from other authors who travelled among the various tribes of Indians.""  The author goes as far as adding a preface and introduction borrowed from Thomas Jefferson's communications to Congress and calling it a ""recommendation"" from the President.  This ""apocryphal edition"" was first published in 1809 in London and Philadelphia, followed by German editions in 1811 and 1812.  Compiled by William Fisher and published by James Sharan in Philadelphia.  The present example includes one portrait and two title pages as noted in Howes ""aa.""

This important work is noted by Howes as the ""earliest full first-hand narrative of the Lewis and Clark expedition, preceding the official account seven years.""  Patrick Gass joined the Lewis & Clark expedition as a private in 1804, and was appointed Sergeant in August of that same year.  He was a skilled carpenter and responsible for the construction of the Corps winter quarters, as well as building canoes and wagons that would ultimately get them to the Columbia River.  While his journal was not as holistic as that of Lewis & Clark, it did provide a reliable record of the journey.  This fourth edition was printed in Philadelphia by Matthew Carey and, according to Streeter, includes the same text and plates as the 1810 edition and the same text as the 1807 edition (which has no plates).  Unique to this edition, however, is the insertion of Carey's small map of 
Louisiana
 (7.5 x 5.6"") at the front of the volume.  The map covers the region from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean showing basic details of the river systems, topography, and the location of various Indian tribes.  The six single-page plates interspersed within the text include: ""A canoe striking on a Tree"", ""Captain Lewis & Clark holding a Council with the Indians"", ""Captain Clark & his men building a line of Huts"", ""Captain Clark and his men shooting Bears"", ""An American having struck a Bear but not kill'd him escapes into a Tree"", and ""Captain Lewis Shooting an Indian.""  262 pages, 12mo, hardbound in contemporary calf with gilt title label on spine.

This is one of the earliest printed maps of Missouri Territory, which was organized in 1812.  It was published in the same year as Lewis & Clark's foundation map, and incorporates many of the new discoveries from that expedition along the Upper Missouri and Columbia rivers.  The map notes a ""probable"" northern boundary from Puget Sound to Lake of the Woods, and a ""probable"" southern boundary extending from San Francisco Bay to the headwaters of the Rio Grande and then southeast to Galveston Bay.  Carey issued a pocket version of this map in the same year, and while it contains the same geography, this larger version includes much more detail in terms of topography and river systems.

This is the third London edition of this landmark map.  Printed in 1817, it follows the 1814 Philadelphia edition, and the 1814 and 1815 London editions.  The London editions contain a re-engraved map by Neele of nearly identical size, omitting the ""Saml. Harrison sc."" and showing the publisher's name below the bottom border. 


The map is widely considered to be one of the most important maps in United States history.  According to Wheat, ""This 1814 map was the progenitor of many later maps, and one of the most influential ever drawn, its imprint still to be seen on maps of Western America.""  He continues, ""This was a great map, a milestone of mapping in its time, and countless place names it gave to the face of America remain today as an ineradicable cultural heritage."" 


The map itself marks the culmination of a 28-month journey in which Meriwether Lewis and William Clark would finally dispel the notion of a 
Northwest Passage
.  Before their discoveries, it was widely believed that the headwaters of the Missouri River and Columbia River were very close to one another geographically, and that the only obstacle to creating a canal or portage was a plateau or gentle hill.  Instead, Lewis and Clark discovered a series of rugged mountains dividing the two rivers.  Additionally, they found that the waters off the western slopes of the Rockies were not navigable, compounding the problem.  As a result of their expedition, the myth of the great Northwest Passage was finally put to rest, and the discoveries of Lewis and Clark would shape the next generation of cartographers and their maps of the western United States.

A number of other fold separations and two small tears at left that extend 1"" and 2"" have also been professionally repaired with some minor loss at fold intersections.  There is light surface soiling and minor foxing.  Text is generally very good with light toning and only occasional foxing, while the two single-page maps are moderately foxed.  The front cover has separated, the back cover has nearly separated, and the spine has essentially perished.  A very worthy candidate for professional rebinding.

This is the large edition of the influential map which details John Charles Fremont's epic exploration of the American West.  Fremont and his traveling companion and topographer, George Carl Preuss, launched the expedition from the frontier settlement of Westport at the juncture of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers.  There Fremont first met Kit Carson who signed on as guide to the expedition.  Traveling across the Rocky Mountains at South Pass to the Columbia River in Oregon Territory, they then continued south along the Sierra Nevada nearly to the ""Pueblo del los Angeles"", northeast to Lake Utah and finally east to the Arkansas River.  Fremont's map and report had a profound influence on emigration to the Far West as his westward route eventually became the Oregon Trail.  Wheat, who called this ""an important step forward from the earlier western maps"" devoted seven text pages to its description. The map was drawn by Charles Preuss ""whose skill in sketching topography...has probably never been surpassed in this country.""  There is much to study and appreciate in this rare map, but we return to Wheat for this short praise: ""To Fremont and his magnificence map of his Second Expedition all praise.  This is an altogether memorable document in the cartographic history of the West, and for it alone Fremont would deserve to be remembered in history."" 


Included is an untitled folding map (23 x 9"") showing their route between Mountain Lake (Lake Tahoe) in the Sierra's and 
Nueva Helvetica
.  Fremont's party enjoyed a two-week respite as the guest of John Sutter near the famous Sutter's Mill.  Also contains an untitled folding map of the Bear River in Utah (8 x 16.5""), and a single page map of 
The Great Salt - Lake
 which is an early map of the area including the front of the Wasatch Mountains. 


This is the Senate issue.  Octavo, hardbound with brown embossed covers and gilt titling on spine, 693 pp., 22 plates and 5 maps.  The body of the book contains Fremont's two reports, titled  ""A Report on an Exploration of the Country Lying Between the Missouri River and the Rocky Mountains"" and ""A Report of the Exploring Expedition to Oregon and North California, in the Years 1843-'44.""

This map has been accorded twofold importance in the development of the westward expansion: first, as a major contribution to geographical and cartographical knowledge, and secondly, as historic documentation of Fremont's third expedition.  The map is a remarkable graphic depiction of this expedition and is considered one of the most important 19th century American maps.  It covers all of the western territories from the 105th Meridian.  Among the most interesting features are the appearance of the term 
Golden Gate
 at the entrance to the Bay of San Francisco, the markings of the 
El Dorado or Gold Region
 in the 
California Gold Fields
, a hypothetical east-west mountain range near the 42nd parallel, and a notation identifying the location of Mormon settlements for the first time.  Wheat illustrates the map and devotes eight pages to its description.


Having been court-marshaled and dismissed from the Army in 1847, Fremont was not asked to publish the details of this last expedition by the Corps of Topographical Engineers as would normally be required.  Instead, the 
Geographical Memoir
 comprised his report.  It was published nonetheless by Congress at the behest of the powerful Senator Thomas Hart Benton, Fremont's father-in-law.  The memoir is also known as Misc. Doc. No. 148, 30th Congress, 1st Session.  This is the large, and increasingly rare, map from that report.  The lot includes the report as well.

A great map of California and the large western territories from this important series of maps originating with Samuel Augustus Mitchell.  The map is filled with early territory and county configurations, the exploration routes of Lewis and Clark, Fremont, Kearney and Cooke, and the Spanish and Oregon trails.  Washington and Oregon have their eastern boundaries at the Continental Divide in the Rocky Mountains adjoining Nebraska Territory and show updated county structure compared to earlier editions.  Their county development is confined to west of the Cascades except for the newly formed Skamania and Walla Walla counties.  Utah Territory extends to Middle Park and Long's Peak in present-day Colorado where it borders Kansas and Nebraska Territory.   Denver does not yet appear nor do any of the early mining settlements to the west, however St. Vrains Fort is located.  New Mexico Territory encompasses parts of present-day Colorado and Arizona and shows the Gadsden Purchase border with Mexico.  County development in California is well underway except in the south where the huge counties of San Diego and San Bernadino dominate.  This issue shows the former Missouri Territory revised to Nebraska and Kansas.  Although dated 1850 in the copyright, this map is from a late 1854 Desilver atlas.  It retains the Thomas, Cowperthwait & Co. decorative rope borders in the characteristic green color.

There are a few minor spots, a faint damp stain that just enters the border at bottom right, and light toning along the edges of the sheet.

Oregon Territory takes in all of present day Washington and Idaho and is bounded in the east by Missouri Territory.  The huge Utah Territory (formed in 1850) covers the region labeled 
Fremont Basin
 and stretches from the California border to just past the Rocky Mountains.  Salt Lake City is noted as the 
Mormon Set.
  New Mexico Territory (also formed in 1850) encompasses parts of present-day Colorado and Arizona and its southern boundary is on the Gila River - pre Gadsden Purchase.  The Gold Region is clearly marked along the Sacramento River and there is no county development shown in the new state.  The 
Oregon Route, Great Spanish Trail from P. Angeles to Santa Fe, Lewis and Clarkes route
 and several other early trails are shown.  The copyright at bottom, by H.N. Burroughs, is dated 1845 although the map was published in 1851.  The map number ""37"" reflects renumbering of maps in this atlas issue to accommodate the Texas map after Louisiana.

An interesting map of the new state of California and the large western territories based on the important Mitchell series.  The map is filled with interesting information, notably, the exploration routes of Lewis and Clark, Fremont, Kearney, and Cooke, and the Spanish and Oregon Trails.  Oregon Territory, with Oregon City as its capital,  has its eastern boundary in the Rocky Mountains adjoining Missouri Territory.  Utah Territory extends to 
Old Park 
and Long's Peak in present-day Colorado.   New Mexico Territory encompasses parts of Colorado, Nevada and Arizona and displays a pre-Gadsden Purchase border along the Gila River.  Only a few counties are delineated in California and the capital is at San Jose.  A large inset shows San Francisco and Environs, which includes much of the 
Gold Region.
  It is this unique inset that differentiates this from the Mitchell map.  From Meyers 
Auswanderungs-Atlas

Known as ""Warren's General Map,"" this is a monumentally important map that is considered to be the first accurate overall picture of the region.  Wheat considered it so important that he dedicated eight pages to its description and called it the most important map produced by the Topographical Engineers.  Drawn on the polyconic projection, the map culminated a half-century of government explorations beginning with Lewis & Clark.  Only 24 years old when assigned the task, Warren used information from the U.S. Land Office, the Coast Survey, Topographical Engineers, the Adjutant General, the Quartermaster General, the Indian Bureau, and Smithsonian Institution to obtain the latest information in developing this map.  The majority of the map was completed by 1854, but it was not fully complete when the first railroad survey report was published in 1855 and thus did not accompany all editions.  A remarkable and scarce map that represents the best geological knowledge of the day.  Printed on two sheets and joined, as issued.

Issued folding with light scattered foxing and toning along the upper half of the map.  There are several splits at fold intersections, along with a long fold separation and 7"" binding tear at top left that have both been repaired on verso with archival tape.  Trimmed to inside the neatline along parts of the left border.

This great map of the western United States was one of the first geological maps of the region.  It illustrates the many mineral resources that helped spur westward migration and expansion.  The legend uses color to identify eleven geological types.  The map is also filled with terrific detail of mountains, watersheds, cities, and roads.  It covers the country from the Ohio River Valley to the Pacific and extends to include the states of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico.  The political divisions include the large western territories of Washington, Oregon, Utah, New Mexico, Nebraska, and Kansas.  Drawn by Thomas Jekyll.

A fascinating and rarely offered railroad map with an accompanying note by Keeler.  The map extends east just past the Mississippi River and shows excellent information on railroads, land offices, Surveyor General's office, forts, military posts, and the location of ores and minerals.  A colored key identifies the areas of the west that contain gold, silver, copper, quicksilver (mercury) and coal.  Also illustrated are the township and range lines of the public land surveys.  This map is also important for its documentation of Indian Reservations, whose lands are shown in orange, but are not listed in the key.  The largest of these Indian Reservations is the ""Tabequache Utes Indian Res."" in western Colorado and the ""Uintah Valley Reserve"" in eastern Utah.  Regarding this map, Wheat says, ""Keelers large and imposing map is of almost unmanageable size, but it offers something of interest in every part of the West and is worth wrestling with.""  This map is similar to Keelers reduced sized 
Map of the Routes of the Union Pacific Railroads with Their Eastern Connections...
, also published in 1867.  A scarce issue.  Mounted on linen, the map folds into hard, brown cloth covers with embossing and gilt titling on front cover.


Keeler's note, which is pasted on the inside front cover, notes: ""Particular attention is invited to the Colorado River as here shown. It is from actual survey , and exhibits that magnificent stream as it has never been mapped before, and as it really is, one of the great rivers of this Continent.""  Despite these claims, there had not yet been a survey of the Colorado River, and its presentation in the map does not show any advances in cartography, and does not yet hint at the existence of the Grand Canyon.  Keeler also purports of the ""official"" nature of the map, both in the title and in his note, however the map was privately printed by Keeler himself and was not a government document.


Keeler's map was one of the largest and most detailed maps of the West at the time and influenced the mapping of the Transmississippi West after the close of the Civil War.

Light toning overall that is more pronounced along the folds, with a number of tiny separations at fold intersections resulting in a couple of tiny areas of loss.  There are some fold separations that have extended through the linen and have been archivally repaired on verso.  There is minor offsetting of the title at bottom left and a few spots of soiling.  The covers are lightly worn and soiled.

This scarce German map presents itself in a style similar to those from Carey & Lea's 
American Atlas
, but is unique to this publication.  It depicts the western United States from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean, with Oregon Territory occupying the region west of the Continental Divide, and Missouri Territory occupying the region to its east above Arkansas Territory.  In the Pacific Northwest, Oregon Territory extends well into Canada reflecting U.S. interests in the region.  The map shows good detail of topography, the river systems, and names numerous Indian tribes.  Surrounded on three sides by panels of German text (21.9 x 15.6"") describing the features of the two territories.

This early map of Oregon Territory was copyrighted by the firm of Illman & Pilbrow in 1836 and published in Burr's atlas.  A historical and interesting map, it draws on the explorations of Jedediah Smith, Lewis & Clark, the Hudson Bay Company and John Jacob Astor's Company for its remarkable degree of information and accuracy.  The Oregon Territory extends all the way east to the 
Stony Mountains
.  The northern boundary with the 
British Possessions
 is set at 54°40' per the ""Boundary of Russian Possessions settled by Convention in 1824.""  The southern boundary is at 42° per the ""treaty with Spain 1819.""  East of the Stony Mountains, the northern boundary is today's Canadian border and noted as per the ""treaty with Gt. Britain 1818.""  In the south, a remnant of the River of the West theory appears, as the 
Los Mongos River,
 that flows to the Pacific from the large 
L. Timpangos
.  Information and place names include 
Friendly Indians, Ft. Clapsop or Ft. George, Edmonton Factory
, and much more.  Burr was appointed to be topographer to the U.S. Post Office Department in 1832 and was unable to complete the maps for his atlas. Thomas Illman assumed that responsibility, publishing it using the New York firm of D.S. Stone.  The imprint of Thomas Illman is below the neatline.

A nice example with two small worm holes in the image and light soiling.  There is some errant blue ink in the right blank margin and border.

 An important 
Mexican-American War
 period map that shows the route of Col. Kearny and his 
Army of the West
 as they traveled from Ft. Leavenworth to Los Angeles via Santa Fe and San Diego.  Wheat states that the map was an important milestone in the cartographic development and accurate determination of the geography of the West.  A large map printed on three sheets, joined as issued. 


The map is accompanied by the Senate edition of Emory's important report documenting the 1846-1847 journey.  Emory's reports are enjoyable reads and this is no different, with passages such as ""I stopped in the little town of Isoletta, to visit my friend, the accolade, who has the reputation, Indian though he be, of being the most honest man and best maker of brandy in the territory.""  The report summarizes the activity of the U.S. Army of the West after the capture of New Mexico with important early views of the region.  It is illustrated with 26 lithographed views, three battle maps, and 14 botanical plates.   The important view of San Diego is present.  The battle plans are: Sketch of the Actions fought at San Pasqual in Upper California; Sketch of the Passage of the Rio San Gabriel...; and Sketch of the 
Battle of Los Angeles
 Upper California.  Fought between the Americans and Mexicans Jany. 9th, 1847.  Complete with the two page report (Appendix No. 7) by P. St. Geo. Cooke, Major 2d Dragoons.  Printed by Wendell and Van Benthuysen.  This is the second edition printed, and thus did not originally contain the large folding map by Emory, which was included in the first and third editions.  416 pages, 40 plates, and 3 single-page maps.

This pair of maps represents one of the most important exploring efforts of the American Southwest.  Ives published his explorations in a series of four maps - these being the first two.  In his book 
Mapping of the Trans-Mississippi West
, Carl Wheat devotes several pages to these two maps saying they are two of the best created by the remarkable F.W. von Egloffstein.  They were engraved using his system that imparts the appearance of depth to the topography and nearly mimics a satellite image.  A remarkable accomplishment for the time.  The maps were published in 1861.  Each map measures the approximate size given.


The first map shows the topography and geology of the lower Colorado River in four panels (each about 8.5"" x 14""), beginning at the Gulf and ending in Black Canyon at Fortification Rock.  Locates and names Pt. Invincible, Ogden's Landing, Fort Yuma, Lighthouse Rock, The Needles, the location of Beale's Crossing, Bullshead (today's Bullhead City), Painted Canyon, Fortification Rock, and much more.  Numerous rapids are noted including 
Roaring Rapid 3 large rocks & one sunken rock below
, and 
Violent Rapid with rocks on both sides
.


The second map details the region around the Grand Canyon and Little Colorado River.  It shows the river from about Needles (Whipple's Crossing and Mojave Canyon) north through Black Canyon, to the Little Colorado and then north to beyond the survey's limit as the riverbed fades to nothing.  The map locates Fort Defiance, Campbell's Pass, Zuni, Moquis (Hopi) Pueblos, San Francisco Springs (Flagstaff), Las Vegas, the Mormon Road, numerous Indian tribes, and much more.  Several important exploration routes and trails are shown including The Old Spanish Trail, Whipple's trail 1854-4 and Beale's trail.

Both maps are issued folding with light scattered foxing, a damp stain in the left blank margin, and a binding trim at left.  The binding trim of Map No. 1 extends into the image, and an associated 4"" binding tear has been closed on verso with archival tape.  Map No. 2 has light offsetting.

Large and extremely detailed chart by J.H. Clark, U.S. Commissioner, that was drawn by J.E. Weyss, circa 1860.  The map features the survey lines between Texas and New Mexico with good topographical detail.  Information includes forts, Raton Pass, the Santa Fe, and Albuquerque trails, numerous explorers' routes, Indian trails, and more.  The map is an interesting historical curiosity because it was not published when the survey was finished due to the outbreak of the Civil War.  In 1902 the map was belatedly included in a Geological Survey Bulletin by Marcus Baker.  Printed by the Norris Peters Co., Photo-Litho. 

Issued folding with a few minor spots, a hint of toning along the folds, and some short fold separations, some of which are closed with archival tape on verso.  There is a binding trim and associated tear in the bottom right blank margin.

This is a later edition of this rare and important map of the Territory of New Mexico stretching from Pike's Peak to Cooke's Wagon Road in Sonora.  Originally published in 1852, the map was distributed to officers in the region and those who requested it, but it never appeared in a report, making the original essentially unobtainable.  Compiled by Lt. John G. Parke and drawn by Richard H. Kern, it shows the region in the years immediately following the Mexican-American War, when many boundary disputes were still ongoing and large swaths of land were unexplored.  It replaced Abert's map as the primary cartographic source for the region.  Richly detailed, it extends to show parts of Texas, Indian Territory, Utah Territory, California, and parts of Mexico.

This terrific pair of maps focus on Mobile, Alabama during the Civil War.  The first (in hand color) covers Mobile Bay in excellent detail with several small bays identified within.  Obstructions, fortifications, floating batteries, lines of entrenchment, and a Spanish fort are shown.  It also identifies the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, St. Stephens Road, a telegraph road, and the nearby town of Blakely.  The second map (in black & white) zooms in on Mobile, which is depicted in grid-like plan form.  Once again the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, various roads, and the city's fortifications are located.  The coat-of-arms for the Army Corps of Engineers is shown next to each title.  These maps are plates No. 9 and No. 10 from the report and are early published Civil War maps; most reports and maps withheld publication until the 1890's to allow time for the national wound to sufficiently heal before a public discussion of the conflict.

This important and early map of the 
California Gold Rush
 was made from Lt. Derby's original sketch by J. Mc. H. Hollingsworth in the office of the 10th Military Dept.  It is historically important, not only for its depiction of Gen. Riley's route, but because it names, for the first time, certain actual mining camps in the middle Sierra foothills; Mormon Island (misspelled Mormont), Coloma (mislabeled Colluma), Curtis, Sullivan's, Corons, Jamestown, Woods, and Sonora.  The entire route of the Riley party is noted, with the dates of their visits to the various camps, and covers the region from Monterrey Bay, north to Sacramento and east to the gold diggings.

The cartography is based in part on Hessel Gerritsz' chart circa 1631, and nearly all the place names on the chart are Spanish.  The chart is oriented with north to the left, with a bit of the Yucatan Peninsula shown at lower right.  Three insets depict the Cuban harbors: Matanzas Bay, Havana Harbor and Hondo Bay.

Published around the time that the Florida Territory was officially established as a possession of the United States, this fascinating map shows the territory in nice detail.  Most of the settlements, including St. Augustine, are located in the northern part of the territory, while the southern portion of the peninsula, under Seminole control, is bereft of European presence.  A single road connects St. Augustine to other settlements in its vicinity, and numerous forts are identified.  The territory's many waterways are delineated, with some swampland depicted.  The Florida Keys are called 
the Martyrs
, a name generated by Juan Ponce de Leon in 1513, when he charted the islands.  Parts of Georgia, Alabama, and Cuba are visible along with numerous smaller islands and currents off the coast.  The map is on a full folio sheet (20.7 x 16.6"") with English text that details the territory's geography, population (less than 10,000), major towns, government, history, and more.  Andrew Jackson and William P. Duvall are listed as the territory's first two governors.  Drawn by Fielding Lucas, Jr. and engraved by Young & Delleker.

Lake Okeechobee (here Lake Macaco) is incorrectly located, which is a common error on maps of this period because the region was largely unexplored.

Several land grants are also noted, including those of Arredondo, Miranda, Delespine, and Fleming, which had been granted by the Spanish government prior to ceding the territory of Florida to the United States in 1821.  There are three inset maps detailing Pensacola, Tallahassee, and St. Augustine.  The map reflects the configuration of counties in 1832 with the recent organization of Franklin and Columbia Counties.  Water routes from St. Augustine and Pensacola to various ports are described above and below the map.  Although dated 1833, this map first appeared in Tanner's 1835

Lake Okeechobee (here Lake Macaco) is located with better accuracy, however another lake directly to its north is named Lake Okeechobee.  There is better information in central Florida, evidence of further exploration in the area.  Several Spanish land grants have disappeared, with only Arredondo and Miranda remaining.

The map was drawn by Joseph Goldsborough Bruff and finely engraved by D. McClelland of the Topographical Engineers.  Bruff was a draftsman and cartographer who served as a mapmaker for both the United States Army and the Bureau of Topographical Engineers.  After news of the gold rush reached Washington DC, Bruff organized the Washington City and California Mining Association and led an expedition to California to seek gold.

A rare, early chart of Pensacola Harbor, showing the locations of forts St. Charles and St. Rose, as well as soundings and anchorages.  This is the first detailed printed map of the area, based on earlier French surveys made in conjunction with the reoccupation of the harbor from the Spanish by the French under command of Champmeslin in September 1719.


This map was included in Antoine Laval's 
Voyage de la Louisiane
, the report by the scientist of a 1720 expedition to the Florida and Louisiana coasts, commanded by Valette-Laudun.  The Valette-Laudun excursion resulted from public and governmental interest in the French colony, no doubt attributable to John Law's speculative land efforts with the Company of the West.  Although the account was not published until 1728, after the collapse of the speculation, the work was by far the most comprehensive collection of Gulf Coast material of its time.

This large, scarce, early survey of the bar, harbor and bay at Pensacola was conducted simultaneously with possession of the Florida Territory by the United States in 1822.  This transfer from Spain had been authorized in 1819 by the Adams-Onis Treaty.  Pensacola Bay had long been recognized as the best and most defensible harbor on the Gulf of Mexico, beginning with the attempted occupation by the Spanish in 1559 of the first European settlement in the United States.  After gaining control over Florida in the 1763 Treaty of Paris at the conclusion of the French and Indian War, Britain divided Florida into East and West colonies with Pensacola as the capital of West Florida.  The largest battle ever fought in Florida was at Pensacola in May of 1781 with Spain defeating the English and thereafter taking control again over Florida.  While the survey was concluded in 1822, it was not officially published until 1836 as an outgrowth of interest in establishing an inland canal from Pensacola to Mobile Bay, and from there a safe interior route to New Orleans and the Mississippi River.  This map shows the area from the Grand Lagoon and Foster's Island (present-day Perdido Key) to the Corporation of Pensacola.  Drawn on a scale of 1"" = 1/4 miles with great detail and hundreds of soundings.  Also shown is the terminal of the proposed railroad from Columbus, GA.  Four sheets joined and folding, as issued.  This enormous, detailed survey is quite scarce, as it was not published in many copies of the government reports, and should not be confused with the smaller scale map reduction published in 1835, prior to official publication of this chart.

Nice impression, close trimmed at sides, as issued.  There are some short marginal tears, scattered foxing, and toning along the vertical join line.  A few folds have been closed with archival tissue repair.

This 1818 issue of Carey's map of Georgia is from the rare, late 1818 revised edition of the 
General Atlas
.  Two editions of the 
General Atlas
 were published in 1818, the first simply bearing the date ""1818"" on the title page, with the latter noted as ""Third Edition Improved"" and dated ""June 12, 1818.""  Changes were made to a number of American maps in the June 1818 edition, however none were so great as the changes on the Georgia map.  Examples of this map from the early 1818 edition are nearly identical to the earlier Carey portrayals from 1814-17.  Only a few copies of the June 1818 edition of the 
General Atlas
 or individual examples of the Georgia map from that edition can be located.  After the late 1818 edition, Carey's plates were transferred to Robert Desilver, who re-issued the Georgia map in his atlases from 1822-27. 


When published in 1814, this county map of Georgia was the first atlas map to depict the final ""modern"" boundary between Georgia and Mississippi Territory.  Although Georgia had achieved statehood in 1788, its western border changed numerous times, with several modifications between 1804-12 after the creation of Mississippi Territory.  In this late 1818 edition, ""Mississippi Territory"" is changed to 
Mississippi Territory now Alabama
 due to the creation of Alabama Territory in 1817 before being admitted to the Union in 1819.  The southern boundary of Georgia is also no longer noted as the ""Boundary of the United States,"" foreshadowing the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819, and likely due to the fact that General Andrew Jackson had already invaded and occupied parts of Florida by mid-1818.


There are also numerous updates to the county configuration in this late 1818 edition, derived from the Eleazer Early wall map of Georgia, also issued in 1818.  New counties have been added, including Wayne from part of Glynn, Emanuel from part of Montgomery, and Baldwin from part of Hancock.  In addition, the county lines of every single county have been modified - many greatly so.  The map does not yet show several counties that were established in December 1818, including Habersham, Hall, Gwinnett, Walton, Irwin, and Appling, all of which reduced the size of the Indian lands.


The organized portion of the state is confined to north of the Altamaha River and east of the Ocmulgee River.  The remainder of the state is designated for the Cherokee, Creek, and Seminole Indians.  A number of towns and roads are shown throughout the organized portion of the state, with just a few roads extending to the west, most passing through Buzzard Roost.  The Okefenokee Swamp is illustrated along the East Florida border.

According to Streeter, this seldomly seen map of Illinois Territory is the ""earliest Illinois Map.""  It is also listed in Phillips 
A List of Maps of America
 as the first map under the Illinois header. 


The map itself covers the western portion of Illinois between the Mississippi River and the Illinois River, from just north of St. Louis to just south of Davenport, Iowa.  Lake Peoria is here called 
Lake Peoire
 and the creek just to its west that flows into the Illinois River is labeled 
Kickaboo or Red Bud Cr.
  Below the map image is a printed grid with an area colored in red that corresponds to a tract in the map with the manuscript notation ""Gentle rolling prairie rich soil fit for Cultivation"" and signed by John Gardiner.  Most, if not all, of these maps would have included similar notations regarding each tract of land that was being awarded.  On verso is a manuscript signature of Fowler Preston of Granby, Hampshire County, Massachusetts that states he was ""on his way to Illinois."" 


John Gardiner was the chief clerk of the General Land Office until 1821.  Following the War of 1812, the GLO was tasked with surveying the frontier lands and quickly distributing them to war veterans as payment for their services.

Issued folding and now flattened with minor foxing, several tiny minuscule holes along the folds, and numerous fold separations that have been archivally repaired on verso with minor loss of image.

This map was issued in the 26-page 
Report from the Secretary of War, Transmitting Copies of Reports of the Topographical Bureau in Relation to Internal Improvements in the Territory of Wisconsin...
 by Captain Thomas Jefferson Cram of the Topographical Engineers (report not included).  Cram (1804-1883) was born in New Hampshire and graduated fourth in his class from the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York.  In 1838, he joined the U. S. (Army) Topographical Engineers, where he received a captain's commission and was assigned to the Great Lakes harbor surveys.  In the 1840s he surveyed the Michigan and Wisconsin boundary, and in 1855 he became Chief of the Topographical Engineers, Western Division.  He was promoted to Lt. Colonel in 1861, served with distinction in the Civil War and was rewarded with the title of Brevet General in 1866.  He retired in 1869. 

The map is clean and bright with just a hint of offsetting.  Dog-eared at bottom left where the map folded into the report.

This scarce map shows the route from below Barboursville, Kentucky, to the confluence of the Cumberland River and the Great South Fork,  just above Nashville. It is from Howard Stansbury's report and survey concerning the practicability of extending steam boat navigation up the Cumberland River.  The region surrounding the upper Cumberland River was rich in mineral resources and Congress wanted to understand the feasibility of removing natural obstacles in order to access these resources.  The map includes four cross sections titled: 
Shadowen's Shoal, White Cliff Ripple, End of Smith's Shoals,
 and 
Long Shoal
.  It is decorated with an elaborate compass point and terrific lettering in the title, which exactly matches the fancy lettering used on steamboats.  This is an early work by Stansbury, who eighteen years later commanded an important expedition to Utah.  A large (two-sheets joined) and early map that is very uncommon.

Issued folding with light scattered foxing and an edge tear at right that has been closed with tape on verso.

Filson's landmark, rare map of Kentucky extends from the Ohio River in the north to the Cumberland River in the south.  It contains numerous notes on the topography and nature of the land and features a legend identifying forts, villages, mills, and even the ""huts of savages"" (Indian settlements).  John Filson (1753 - 1788) was the first Historian of Kentucky.  Moving from Pennsylvania about 1782, he settled in Lexington where he divided his time between teaching and surveying land claims.  He wrote 
The Discovery, Settlement and Present State of Kentucke
 in 1784.  The ""Map of Kentucke"" was engraved and printed in Philadelphia and was reprinted several times prior to 1793 but his plan for a second edition was not realized.  He purchased land at the junction of the Ohio and Licking rivers, the future site of Cincinnati, which he named Losantiville.  His survey and plan of the town is visible in the structure of today's downtown Cincinnati.  In 1788 while on a surveying expedition near the Great Miami River, he disappeared when the party was attacked by Shawnee Indians.  


The map is still bound in 
Histoire de Kentucke, Nouvelle Colonie a l'Ouest de la Virginie
, which was translated into French by M. Parraud.  The book contains a vast array of information on Kentucky, including the discovery, the acquisition, the establishment, and a description of the topography and nature.  Also included is some history on Colonel Daniel Boon and the Native Indians in the region.  234 pp., bound in full mottled calf with gilt title label on spine.

The map has light toning, a few spots of foxing, and a 1"" binding tear at right that has been closed on verso with archival tape.  Text is very good with occasional light toning or foxing with some minor worm tracks in the right margin of the last 80 pages.  There is an old bookplate on the front pastedown.  Covers are lightly rubbed and the joints are slightly cracked.

This rare Kentucky map was first produced by John Filson in 1784 and here republished in 1793, one year after Kentucky achieved statehood.  The map extends from the Ohio River in the north to the Cumberland River in the south and shows three counties: Fayette, Jefferson and Lincoln.  It is filled with notations including ""a bloody battle fought here"" and ""the large Bones are found here.""  Also shown are settlements, prominent homes, mills, forts, ""wigwams,"" salt licks, the river system, and topography.  Numerous roads and paths are depicted, including a ""Warriers Path,"" ""Gen.l Clarks War Road,"" and a path connecting to the old settlements in Virginia ""thro' the great Wilderness.""  Includes an inset at top ""A Plan of the Rapids, in the River Ohio"" which was not on the 1784 edition.  John Filson (1753 - 1788) was the first Historian of Kentucky.  Moving from Pennsylvania about 1782, he settled in Lexington where he divided his time between teaching and surveying land claims.  He wrote 
The Discovery, Settlement and Present State of Kentucke
 in 1784, in which the first edition of this map was included.  In 1788, while on a surveying expedition near the Great Miami River, he disappeared when the party was attacked by Shawnee Indians. 


This edition was published November 23, 1793 by John Stockdale, and appeared in Stockdale's edition of Filson's 
 The Discovery, Settlement and Present State of Kentucky
 (1793) and two different 1794 editions of Jedidiah Morse's 
The American Geography; Or, A View of the Present Situation of the United States of America...
 - one that included 3 maps and the other that included 25 maps.  Although there were other reduced-sized editions of Filson's map that were published after the initial 1784 edition, the 1793 Stockdale edition is the only other full-sized edition of the map.  It is also the only obtainable full-sized edition of Filson's map, as the 1784 editions are nearly all held in institutions.

A sharp impression, issued folding with light soiling and offsetting, and now pressed and professionally backed with archival tissue to repair fold separations and tears.  The repaired tears are all in the bottom third of the image, three of which extend about 1"" to 1.5"" from the folds at bottom left, and the other that extends 5"" into the image at bottom right.  There is a small sliver along the vertical fold at top and bottom that was likely cut by the bookbinder, and has been professionally replaced with period correct paper with a minor amount of the image seamlessly replaced in facsimile.  Narrow left margin, as issued.  The map presents itself very well.

This uncommon map of Kentucky features towns, wagon roads, and excellent detail of the state's rivers and creeks.  County configuration is current to roughly 1802 or 1803, with the newly formed Adair County shown and an unnamed area in the northeast corner of the state that's soon to be Greenup.  The county lines are inaccurately drawn in many spots: Barren is significantly smaller than it should be and is located north of Cumberland; Pulaski has an unusual shape; the area that should be Floyd is part of Fleming; Breckinridge is nowhere to be found.  The unnamed region in the southwest corner of the state is Chickasaw territory.  Topographical detail of the Cumberland Mountains extends south of the Kentucky-Tennessee border to show the 
Cumberland Gap
.  The map also locates the Ft. Knox in Vincennes, Indiana, an important outpost on the Wabash River.  Drawn by Samuel Lewis and engraved by H.S. Tanner.  Lucas' 
General Atlas
 is known as one of the finest general atlases produced in the U.S. at the time, due to the high quality paper, superior engraving quality, and attractive coloring style.

This scarce map depicts the lower Mississippi.  It centers on New Orleans and spans from Trinity River in Texas to Mobile Bay.  The Mississippi River, here labeled as 
Fl. de St. Louis
, is prominently shown with nice detail of its mouth at the Gulf of Mexico.  Several smaller rivers in the region are delineated, most notably the Red River, and lakes and bays are named as well.  Several forts are located, including Fort Natchez and the ruins of a former Fort Natchez site.  Indian lands, marshlands, highlands, and a silver mine are identified as well.


Le Page du Pratz, a French military engineer, resided in Louisiana in the early part of the eighteenth century.  During this period he made a five-month tour of the interior of Louisiana.  On his return to France he wrote this important history of Louisiana based on his own adventures combined with information from other French explorers including Bourgmont, Charlevoix, and Dumont de Montigny.  Thomas Jefferson owned the English edition of Le Page du Pratzs work and used it as a reference source for his treatise on Louisiana.  Meriwether Lewis took a borrowed edition on the expedition to the Pacific and made several references to the work in his journal of the expedition.

This rare Parliamentary report was a reaction to the great numbers of citizens emigrating from England, Ireland and Scotland.  The select committee was formed to look into the issue, but in the end recommended that emigration should not be state aided.  Much of the committee's interest was directed toward Ireland and to whether landlords could assist by clearing estates and giving free passages to their dispossessed tenants.  The majority of the book is concerned with hearings and transcripts of testimony, the tone that at times is startling, to say the least.  There are many similar examples, but consider this passage from page 257:  ""Are you aware of any new causes now operating in Ireland, that have a tendency to check this progressive increase of population? -- No, indeed I am not; I don't know of any.""  ""Can you contemplate anything that can remedy the evil [of increasing populations], other than the removal of a certain portion of these unemployed persons? -- I do not think there is any other; I can think of no other.""  The emigration was focused on the United States, in this case Louisiana near the confluence of the Red and Mississippi Rivers.  The Appendix lists Petitions by city and occupation ""of Persons desirous of Emigrating from the Untied Kingdom,""  together representing thousands of individuals.  The book includes five large folding maps showing land available.  The maps are preceded by a copy of the US act making available for purchase lands at no less than $1.25 per acre to anyone. 


The maps are by Charles Gordon, surveyed by G. Davis, Surveyor of Public Lands (United States) South of the State of Tennessee, and by Levon Wailes, Surveyor of Public Lands in the states of Louisiana & Mississippi.  Each measures approximately 16"" x 14"" and uses hand coloring to indicate sold lands.  The maps include:

Andrew Talcott, U.S. Topographical Engineer, conducted the first detailed survey of the Mississippi River delta from February to July, 1838.  The results of the survey were compiled and printed the following year.  At the time, New Orleans was the fifth largest city in the United States and the dominant port on the Gulf of Mexico; the economy of the city was entirely tied to river commerce.  Steamboat traffic had grown dramatically from the city's inception in 1812 to the 1830s, so getting material to New Orleans from the entire upper Mississippi basin took a fraction of the time it had previously.  The problem of continuous navigation by seagoing vessels through the passes of the Mississippi into the Gulf had not been adequately addressed.  The impetus for the Talcott survey in 1838 was to determine a way to increase water depths over the river mouth bars to allow year-round, unfettered river/Gulf boat traffic; the first step was an accurate survey.


Several interesting landmarks are noted on the chart.  At Northeast Pass, the ""North East Light"" is shown near a ""Salt Spring.""  This lighthouse is more commonly known as the Franks Island light and was put into service in March 1823 when Northeast Pass was preferred over the other river entrances by mariners.  Initially contemplated by architect Benjamin Latrobe in 1817 as a classical stone structure, the original lighthouse failed prior to completion due to the heavy mass built on deltaic mud.  The second, simpler lighthouse attempt proved highly successful and was used until completion of the light at the nearby Pass a Loutre in 1856.  Over time, the structure sank vertically into the mud some 20 feet before it was destroyed by a hurricane in 2002.  Also shown nearby is the location of the historic Spanish and French Balize on Balize Bayou, noted as ""Old Spanish Magazine.""  The chart covers the area from the Gulf to Fort St. Phillip (1810) and Ft. Jackson (1832) across the river on the north.  ""South Light"" appears on the sand spit at the mouth of South Pass.  Completed in 1832, the light existed only until 1839, when the structure was torn from its foundation by logs swept downriver.  Printed on two sheets and joined, as issued.

Issued folding with two areas of marking or foxing and a few fold intersection splits.  A portion of the joint has come loose, but the two sheets are still solidly attached.  Trimmed to neatline at bottom, as issued.

First edition of this handsome map of Mississippi that details the county seats, roads, towns and settlements, and watershed.  Development is primarily in the southern portion and mostly along the rivers with virtually no other settlements noted.  Monroe is the only county in the north, which was carved out of Chickasaw Indian lands where Cotton Gin Port is located.  The early U.S. government built a cotton gin here in 1801 as part of a ""plan of civilization"" for the Chickasaw Indians.  The huge Choctaw Indians region occupies the middle section.  In it are noted three missionary stations: Mayhew, Elliott and Monroe, plus the Old Agency, and Yazoom Lower Town.  The map shows 18 counties, correct for about 1822, plus the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indian areas.  Engraved by Young & Delleker.  Finley published his atlases annually between 1824-1834, with one final edition appearing in 1836 (Ristow states his last atlas was 1834).

Original color with light staining confined to the blank margins.

This attractive 19th century map of pre-Civil War Mississippi by Charles Desilver features good detail of the numerous towns and villages, rivers, roads, and one active railroad linking Jackson and Vicksburg.  County configuration is current to around 1846 with an expanded Jackson County, although the Lafayette-Marshall border is outdated.  Some distances are noted between cities along main roads.  The table on the left gives the steamboat routes between Natchez and New Orleans and Natchez and Pittsburgh.  Despite the Charles Desilver copyright imprint with a date of 1850, Desilver had no interest in the publication of the atlas until mid-1854.  Therefore this is a remnant date from the original Thomas, Cowperthwait & Co. copyright.  This issue was actually published in 1856.

An important early map of eastern Ohio completed under the direction of Thomas Hutchins, who was the first and only official Geographer to the United States.  In accordance with the Land Ordinance of 1785, Hutchins conducted the first survey that divided public land into Ranges and Townships, but it was not until 1815 that the township plat, a ""planimetric base map that laid down legal subdivisions in each township"" assumed its modern form. This government land division approach became the standard throughout the Midwest, South, and West in the 19th century.  This map is one of the first of its kind.

Issued folding with light toning and scattered foxing along the lower fold.  There is a short fold separation confined to the right blank margin and an edge tear at top that has been closed on verso with archival tape.

This pocket almanac features a detailed plan of Cincinnati that identifies numerous sites of interest, including the old Fort Washington, various pork houses, Woodward College (one of the first public schools in the United States), and the Western Museum, an infamous museum of regional artifacts that evolved into a showcase for curiosities, a precursor to P.T. Barnum's American Museum. The frontispiece is a 
View of Cincinnati, in 1809
 from the vantage of the mouth of the Licking River, across the Kentucky border in Newport.  In addition to day-by-day weather reports from the previous year, the almanac includes a historical and topographical sketch of the city, ""Remarkable Events, and Obituary Notices,""and comprehensive lists of steamboats, churches, banks, insurance companies, colleges, hotels, and more.  At the time of publication, Cincinnati was the sixth largest city in the United States.  This almanac provides a glimpse of the city in the midst of its big boom.  Published by Glezen & Shepard.  Hardbound in brown cloth boards.  82 pp.

In 1905 the Five Indian Nations, concerned how statehood for Oklahoma might affect them, held a constitutional convention with the view to forming their own state.  A constitution was formalized and submitted to Congress.  They also partitioned the nations into 48 counties, as shown on this scarce map.  In 1907 Oklahoma did indeed gain statehood and, as the Indians feared, absorbed Indian Territory in the process.  At that time, Oklahoma retained the names of 20 of the 48 counties from the State of Sequoyah.  A large depiction of the ""Great Seal of the State of Sequoyah"" is below the title.  Drawn by D.W. Bolich and printed by the Aug. Gast Bank Note & Litho Company.

Chartered in 1826, the Danville and Pottsville Railroad was one of the earliest railroads in Pennsylvania.  The line was intended to link the Schuylkill River with the Susquehanna River in order to facilitate the movement of coal to various nearby markets.  Construction of the line began concurrently at the end points, but due to the rugged terrain and financial difficulties, the line was never completed (leaving an 18 mile void).  Cartographically, the plan shows the proposed railroad winding its way through steep terrain, with roads, canals, drainage, and individual property owners named.  The map also depicts the Mount Carbon Railroad and Mill Creek Railroad in the vicinity of Pottsville.  Below the map is an elevation profile demonstrating the challenges of the route.  Published by Kennedy & Lucas's Lithography in Philadelphia.  According to WorldCat, there are only two institutional listings for this map (Library of Congress and Penn State).

This is the third state of this fascinating map of South Carolina by Samuel Lewis.  The topography of the state is shown in fine detail, as are precincts, towns, waterways, and roads.  As a result of the distorted scale of the latitude measurements, the state appears stretched from north to south.  In addition, the northwest border with Georgia extends South Carolina farther west than is accurate.  Two of the most influential names in American cartography were Samuel Lewis and Mathew Carey.  Samuel Lewis was a celebrated draftsman and cartographer who learned his trade from the prominent English cartographer Aaron Arrowsmith.  Engraved by William Barker.

Original outline color on watermarked paper with a bit of foxing along the centerfold and some light printer's ink residue.  A centerfold separation that extends 1.5"" into the image at bottom has been archivally repaired.

This handsome map of South Carolina shows the 28 counties along with settlements, forts, early roads, canals, battlefields and Indian villages.  A key provides symbols for the locations of churches, meeting houses, post offices, schools, ponds, creeks, inlets, swamps, springs (
swash
), and fords.  The county configuration is circa 1825, prior to Pendleton County being divided into Anderson and Pickens Counties in 1826.  The map is surrounded by panels of French text.  Buchon produced the French edition of Carey & Lea's 
American Atlas
.  He used a better quality paper and today his maps are generally found in better condition than his American counterparts.  The dimensions given are for the map only; overall, the large folio sheet measures 24.1 x 17.8"".

Original color with light scattered foxing and minor soiling in the blank margins.  The top corners of the sheet have been trimmed, but there is still ample margin for framing.

This fascinating map was produced by C.O. Boutelle, Asst. U.S. Coast Survey, under the direction of Rear Admiral J.A. Dahlgren U.S.N.  It shows the surveys of the shore line, channels, and fortifications with the location of Union and Rebel Batteries shown in color.  It details positions of obstructions,torpedoes, and shipwrecks, including the Housatonic, Keokuk, Flamingo, and many more.  Tracks of numerous torpedoes are detailed.  Many interesting notes include one giving the position of

This is one of the earliest accurate maps devoted specifically to the Texas coast.  The information was gathered from Spanish sources and Humboldts 
Carte Generale...Nouvelle Espagne
 (1809).  There is a jumble of islands dotting the coast from Galveston Bay (here called Baie Trinidad) to the mouth of the Rio Grande (Rio del Norte).  Laredo, San Antonio, Galveston, and Ft. Matagorda are located but there is no sign yet of any Anglo settlements.  In addition to the Texas coast, this elegant map shows a small part of Mexico and Louisiana.  A large box at right contains extensive text on mining in Mexico from Humboldt.  


The 
Atlas Universel
 was the first atlas to present all the maps on the same scale (1: 1,641,836) about one inch to 26 miles, with each map covering an area of approximately 10 degrees longitude (from Paris) and 6 degrees of latitude.  It was also considered to be the first lithographic atlas ever published.  The maps were meant to be joined together to form a huge globe measuring 7.775 meters in diameter.  Only one edition of the atlas was published in 1825-27, and the subscription list shows that just 810 copies were sold; thus the maps are very scarce on the market today.

This first edition, early emigrant guide does not list an author, but is generally attributed to a M. Fiske.  According to Streeter, the book gives a ""fresh and interesting picture of life in Texas at that time.""  The volume is handsomely illustrated with 4 plates that Streeter describes as well designed ""and perhaps are the earliest of sporting scenes in the West.""  While small in size, the highly detailed plates engraved by J.T. Hammond include: 
Mr. Neil's Estate near Brazoria
, 
Shooting a Deer on the Prairie
, 
Lazooing a Horse of the Prairie
, and 
Road Through a Cane Brake
.  The frontispiece to the volume is the important 
Map of the State of Coahuila and Texas
 that shows early land grants including Austin's Colony, Beales Grant, De Witt's Grant, Thorns Grant, and Dominguez Grant to name a few.  According the Martin & Martin, the map is ""clearly based upon Austin's sources.""  In addition to the land grants, the map identifies ""Herds of Buffalo"" and Comanches Indians in west Texas.  Engraved by W. Hooker, this map would also appear in Mary Austin Holleys 
Texas
, which was published a few short months later.  264 pages, folding map, 4 plates, and a 4 page meteorological journal.  12mo, hardbound in green cloth with gilt tile and illustration on spine.  Published by Goodrich & Wiley in New York.

The folding map is good to very good and has been backed with old linen to reinforce and repair a 9"" binding tear at right.  The map also has minor foxing and light toning.  The 4 plates have light to moderate foxing, and the text is bright with occasional foxing.  There are minor pencil notations on the front and rear pastedowns, and ink notations on the rear free end paper.  Light overall external wear with bumped edges.

This uncommon map chronicles an early battle between Mexican and American forces that led to the formal declaration of war on May 13th, 1846.  Texas had officially been admitted to the Union in 1846; however Mexico did not recognize the United States' claims on Texas and considered it a rebelling province.  The hostilities had been building since the April 24th Thornton Affair, in which a 63-man patrol sent to reinforce U.S. claims in the area was attacked by a 2000-strong Mexican cavalry.  General Zachary Taylor came with 2400 troops to relieve the forces at the makeshift U.S. fort, later named Fort Brown.  On May 8, General Arista intercepted Taylor's force with a 3400-man army and the hostilities began in earnest with battles at Palo Alto and Resaca de Palma.  This map is from the first reports of the battles.  It shows Mexican army encampments, batteries, the positions of the Mexican cavalry and artillery, the movements of the troops, and the thick chaparral growth in the region.

This complete government report describes the survey of the Texas coast that began in 1848 under the direction of A.D. Bache, Superintendent U.S. Coast Survey.  This is the Senate edition, which was published a week before the House edition of the report.  It includes the 
first published chart of the survey of the Texas coast
 ""Sketch G Showing the progress in Section No. 9,"" centered on Galveston City and extending to include the West and East bays and north to Edward's Point.  In the 1840s the U.S. coastline under the Coast Survey's charge nearly doubled due to boundary changes related to the end of the Mexican War and the resolved boundary dispute in the Pacific northwest between the U.S. and Great Britain.  Surveying work began at Galveston Bay with triangulations laid out in every direction and key points determined from Galveston Bay to the mouth of the Brazos River. 


In addition to Galveston, there are 10 other charts and plates:
 

Sketch A - Coast of New England

Sketch A (tris) - Nantucket Island

Sketch B - Long Island

Sketch B (bis) - Delaware Bay and River

120 pages.  Disbound.  8mo.  Several of the folding charts have never been fully opened due to the manner they were bound in and are not illustrated here for that reason.



A clean and bright example with mostly unopened charts.  The Galveston chart has a short cut along the fold (in a completely unengraved area) that was caused when the text block was trimmed during the binding process.  Sketch B of Long Island has a section missing (which appears to be a primarily unengraved area), also caused by the trimming of the text block.  The last few pages of the report are detached.

This scarce map (9 x 7.3"") appeared in Frederick Law Olmsted's account of his saddle-trip through Texas from 1856-57.  The map omits the Pan Handle, Big Bend and the Valley counties south of Webb County, and is one of the few pre-civil war Texas maps to show the road system, rather than railroads.  Counties, county seats, and topography are also well depicted.  Numerous forts are named, including Fort Martin Scott, Fort Clark, Fort Territ, Fort Inge, Fort Ewell, Fort Phantom Hill, and Fort McKavette.  County lines are approximately up to date for 1857, although there is no sign of Jack county and Bexar district is already named.  Other interesting features are a German settlement in Llano county, an 
Emigrants Route
 from Fort Mason to the Green Mounds, and 
Smith & Whiting's Route to El Paso
.  The map was prepared by Joseph Hutchins Colton.


Frederick Law Olmsted, known by many as the father of American Landscape Architecture, was commissioned by the New York Daily Times (now The New York Times) to conduct a research journey through the American South and Texas from 1852 to 1857.  His reports to the Times were collected into three volumes (
A Journey in the Seaboard Slave States
 (1856), 
A Journey Through Texas
 (1857), 
A Journey in the Back Country in the Winter of 1853-4
 (1860)) and served as thorough and accurate first-person accounts of the pre-war South.  His correspondence on Texas included both observations and statistical research on customs, food, housing, agriculture, business, weather, and the influence of slavery.

The map has light toning along the top edge, a few spots of foxing at top, and a couple of short fold separations at bottom that have been archivally repaired on verso.  The map has a binding trim at bottom left with the bottom left corner creased and a bit fragile, and is bound tight into the volume up to the neatline.  The text is clean and bright and the new covers have a rectangular piece of the spine cut out at bottom.

This scarce map of Texas is based on Jacob de Cordova's 1849 depiction showing the state west  to the Pecos River, here labeled 
R. Puerco
, just north of the Rio Grande.  Even though published in 1857, the map illustrates Texas after it became the 28th state in 1845, but before the Compromise of 1850, when the present boundaries were established.  There were four empresario grant type colonies established during the Republic of Texas period, one being the Fisher and Miller Colony, shown here north of Fredricksburg.  The other three that are no longer noted on this map were Peters' Colony, Castro's Colony and Mercer's Colony. These types of colonies were changed to be more in order with regular U.S. land grants.  West Texas is noted as being the 
Solitudes habitees par les Comanches
. 


The map illustrates the travels of Abbe Emmanuel Domenech in Texas; first in 1846-50, and then again in 1851-2.  Domenech was the first Catholic priest to be ordained in Texas and was charged with the establishment of the Catholic hierarchy in Texas, amid the tensions of the boundary disputes with Mexico.  On his second journey he based himself in Brownsville and visited neighboring places in Texas and Mexico.  The tracks of his missionary activities are shown in pink on the map.  This English edition was engraved by Edward Weller in London and published in the only English edition of Domenech's account, which was first published in French in 1857.

This topographical map was created by Lieut. John D. Webster with assistance from T.E. Mullomny.  It details a strategic portion of the Rio Grande from Matamoros to Boca Chica at the southernmost tip of Texas, an area with significance in the 
Mexican-American War
.   Details includes forts, camps, roads and towns, topography by hachure, vegetation, and numerous soundings in the Rio Grande.  Fort Brown is located across the Rio Grande from Matamoros.  Along the Gulf are located Padre Island, Clark's Island, Brazo Santiago, and Port Isabel.  The small settlements of Falcone, Burgos, Tres Quilas, Arenal, and Burrita are located along the Rio Grande, to mention a few.  Drawn on the scale of one inch per mile, accounting for the remarkable level of detail.

Issued folding with light to moderate toning that is especially pronounced at the top left panel and light offsetting.  There is a 3"" tear in the top left panel and several fold separations, all of which have been closed on verso with archival tape.

This map, along with Gastaldi's

Geographiae

Charming miniature map of Mexico and the whole coastline of the Gulf of Mexico.  The map appears to be based in part on Cornelis de Jode's 
Americae Pars Borealis
 (1593).  Mexico City is shown prominently, with a smoking volcano just to the south.  A number of other cities are labeled in Mexico, while only rivers and capes are noted in the US.  The Rio Grande River is identified as 
R. Escondido

This map first appeared in Barent Langenes' 
Caert-Thresoor
 (Map Treasury), which had a complicated publishing history.  The Map Treasury was first published by Langenes in 1598 with maps by several well-known engravers, including Jodocus Hondius and Pieter van den Keere, and was sold by both Langenes and Cornelis Claesz.  Several editions of the Map Treasury were published through 1609.  In 1600, the maps from the Map Treasury were reissued with new text by Petrus Bertius and published by Claesz under the title 
Tabularum Geographicarum, Contractarum Libri Quatuor
.  Editions of Bertius' 
Tabularum Geographicarum
 appeared in Latin and German through 1650, with the latest editions published by Visscher and Jan Jansson.

This large, handsome map is based largely on Humboldt's map of Mexico, including the graphic representation of the Rocky Mountains and Rio Grande River valley. The map presents a remarkable, emerging picture of the major watersheds originating in the Rocky Mountains - a region long misrepresented on maps of the region.  On the western slope, the headwaters of the Colorado are formed and the erroneous 
Sr. de S. Buenaventura
 flows into a partially shown Salt Lake.  On the eastern part of the map the Platte, Arkansas and Red Rivers are all delineated in great detail, and the course of the 
R. Bravo or Del Norte
 (Rio Grande) is equally well presented with mountains depicted by hachures in orthographic projection.  Further south, the mouth of the Gila is inaccurately placed in the Gulf of California. The map also presents early information in Texas, which is within the 
Intendency of S Louis
.  The 
Pres. de Bejar, Capitol of the Province of Texas
 is located, as is the settlement of La Salle in 1683, and the 
Presidio of Nacogdoch
.  The map is also filled with information on Indian tribes, mines, farms, missions, military posts, roads and 
Stations of Muleteers
.

This incredibly detailed military map was prepared with the latest information provided by the War Department through the 1870's.  Published by Edward Freyhold, the map was created under the direction of General Andrew Atkinson Humphreys, who served as Chief Engineer of the U.S. Army before being promoted to a Union General in the American Civil War.  The map was published in six sheets depicting the United States from Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio to the West Coast.  This lot includes the southeastern sheet, which bears the map title, and the south central sheet.  According to Wheat, the map was ""a major new revision"" of Freyhold's smaller map of 1868, 
Territory Of The United States From The Mississippi River To The Pacific Ocean
, which itself was ""the first major revision of Lieutenant Warren's general map of 1857.""  Freyhold's map was one of the most detailed and modern maps of the Western States of its time.  Wagon roads, railroads, and telegraph lines are shown, illustrating the westward advancement of communication and economic prospects.  Sheet 5, the south central sheet, is filled with intricate topography and watershed information.  Despite the complexity of the cartography, the map is quite beautiful, described by Wheat as ""a superb example of the mapmaker's art, as well as his science.""  The map includes a combination of printed color to denote water and original hand color outlining the states.  Each sheet is dissected into 24 sections, backed with linen, and folds into marbled end papers with a title label written in manuscript, as issued.

Very light toning with minor soiling and a few small splits in the linen at fold intersections.  The marbled covers are moderately soiled and worn.  Please note that the first image is digitally merged to show both sheets together - the sheets are still separate.

This map shows the failed Republic of Texas expedition, under President Mirabeau Lamar, to gain jurisdiction over Sante Fe and develop trade links between Texas and New Mexico.  Many enterprising Texans believed New Mexico would be interested in this relationship, but upon the partys arrival in Sante Fe, they were met by 1,500 Mexican troops.  Spared their lives, the Texan party was forced to march the 2,000 mile route to Mexico City before diplomatic measures guaranteed their release a year later.  Also depicted on the map is Josiah Greggs route from Van Buren, Pikes route from Ft. Smith, and the Chihuahua Trail.  Published in George Kendall's

Pierre Marie Francois, Viscomte de Pages (1748-93), a French naval officer, completed a circumnavigation of the world and expeditions towards both the north and south poles between 1771-76.  During the beginning of his circumnavigation of the world, Pages sailed to New Orleans and then along the Mississippi and Red Rivers to Natchitoches.  Pages then traveled over land across present-day Texas and Mexico by the ""Old San Antonio Road.""  After arriving in Acapulco, Pages continued his journey across the Pacific Ocean.  Pages' account of his travels, including two maps, was published in 1782 in 
Voyages Autour du Monde, et Vers les Deux Poles, par Terre et par Mer...
  Several other editions were published, including an English translation in 1792-93, however not all of the later editions included the maps.


The key map from Pages' account is 
Carte d'une Partie de l'Amerique Septentrionale, qui Contient Partie de la Nle. Espagne...
, which shows Mexico and the southern United States and depicts the route of Pages, from the mouth of the Mississippi River to Acapulco, Mexico.  Engraved by Benard, this map represents one of the most detailed depictions of the region at the time.  In addition to Pages' route, there is excellent detail of villages, forts, missions, political boundaries, ""huts of savages where there are missionaries,"" and ""huts of savages that are not policed.""  
Province de los Texas
 is labeled, surrounded by Indian lands.  A fascinating and very rare map.


The map is accompanied by the three-volume English translation of Pages' account, which was published in 1792-93.  The English translation did not originally include any maps, so the map is likely from an earlier French edition.  Three volumes: xx, folding table, 300 pp.; xii, 268 pp.; xxii, 303pp.  Condition of volumes: The text of the three volumes is in very good condition, with light toning, occasional soiling, and light damp stains affecting about 70 pages of volume I and 50 pages of volume II.  Volumes I and II are disbound, with the text of Volume I beginning to separate.  Volume III is hardbound in original leather, with the spine nearly perished and the boards held on with clear tape.  The boards are heavily scuffed and worn.

The condition code is for the map, which has been professionally conserved.  Issued folding, the map is now flattened and backed in thin, archival tissue, with very light offsetting.  A 1"" binding tear at left, and a tear that just enters the map border at right, have both been professionally repaired.  The binding trim at left has been replaced with period correct paper.  See description above for the condition of the text volumes.

This very rare map of the Southwest and Mexico was issued in D. Juan Corradi's 
Descubrimiento y Conquista de la America o Compendio de la Historia General del Nuevo Mundo
, published in Madrid in 1803.  The map incorporates the latest Spanish information available with cartography based upon Bernardo de Miera Y Pancheco's 
Plan de la Provinca Interna de el Nuevo Mexico
 (1778).  It is quite unusual to see this level of detail on a printed map dated 1802, as this highly guarded information was not available to the public until Humboldt's landmark map of 1811.  It shows the 
R.S. Buenaventura
 running southwest into the Great Salt Lake, and from the west the 
R. de los Dolores
 reaches too far inland and nearly connects to the lake.  This misconception would continue until Fremont's explorations in the 1840s.  Outside of the river systems, there is limited inland detail beyond a few place names and basic topographical features.  The map is augmented by an inset of Mexico City and its surroundings.  Drawn by Gonzalez and engraved by Morata.  A highly unusual Spanish map of the American southwest.

This is the northern sheet of the first French edition of Humboldt's landmark map of the Southwest.  Wheat describes the map as undoubtedly the most important and accurate published map that had yet appeared (as of its 1811 publication date).  He further notes it appears on the map itself that it is drawn in Mexico in 1803, and that it was corrected by Humboldt and three associates in 1809.  Humboldt's map would remain the standard source until Fremont's mapping of the area in the 1840s.  As a testament to the accuracy of the map, contemporaries Zebulon Pike and Aaron Arrowsmith copied copious information in Humboldt's map for their own publications in 1810, one year prior to Humboldt's printed map being released to the public. 


Humboldt, a world-renowned naturalist and explorer, spent 5 years (1799-1804) traveling in South and Central America collecting data on plant and animal life.  In 1803, he arrived in Mexico City to compile his findings into 
Essai Politique Sur le Royaume de la Nouvelle-Espagne...
, and it is during this time that he constructed this map.  Humboldt's reputation provided him access to a vast number of documents and maps held in the local Spanish archives, including important accounts from Costanso, Mascaro, Alzate, de Fer, Urrutia, Pichardo, Lopez, Carces, Font, Venegas, Lafora, and Miera.  In fact, the northern third of the map is based almost entirely from Miera's Escalante earlier map (1777). 


Cartographically, the northern sheet covers Arizona, New Mexico, the northern half of Texas, as well as Utah, Colorado, and Kansas to the north.  In addition to the map's superior accuracy, it is notable for introducing the concept of hachuring (orthographic projection) to convey topography.  However, despite these improvements and innovations, Humboldt's map still contains a few errors including a depiction of the mythical 
Lake Timpanogos
, along with several notes concerning its sources.  Humboldt himself acknowledges the incomplete information and that ""it must be allowed that all that part of the west of North America is still but very imperfectly known.""  


A seminal map of the American Southwest which Streeter describes as ""one of the six most desirable maps of Texas.""

A dark impression with some minor surface soiling that is more prominent in the blank margins.  The sheet was severed along the centerfold and professionally and invisibly repaired on verso with archival materials.  There are several small wormholes along the upper right and left side of the image that are only visible when held to light.

The large map was the most important and accurate map of the region to be published at the time, and would remain the standard source until Fremont's mapping of the area in the 1840s.  As a testament to the accuracy of the map, contemporaries Zebulon Pike and Aaron Arrowsmith copied copious information in Humboldt's map for their own publications in 1810, one year prior to Humboldt's printed map was released to the public. 


Map of the Valley of Mexico and Neighboring Mountains...
 (10.3 x 8.0"").  A highly detailed map of the region with Mexico City at center.  Shows the dramatic topography of the region through the use of dense hachuring, a technique that Humboldt developed. 


Plan of the Port of Veracruz
 (9.7 x 7.9"").  Depicts the fortified city of Vera Cruz with the Castle of S. Juan de Ulna to its northeast.  Filled with numerous soundings and useful navigational notations. 


Plan of the Port of Acapulco
 (4.6 x 7.6"").  A single-page map showing the vicinity around Acapulco.  There is good coastal detail and numerous soundings in the port.

Overall, the plates are clean, tight, and very good to near fine.  The map of New Spain has a 1.5"" fold separation near the middle of the image where it was bound into the volume and has been repaired on verso with archival tape.  The cross-sections have faint text offsetting.  Paper wrappers are lightly soiled.

This was the critical map of the Mexican Boundary Survey.  Initial work had broken down over a Mexican demand that Mexico be given the port of San Diego and the determination of the length of a league.  It provides interesting detail in the vicinity of San Diego and anchors the border determination for this area.  This map is full of  information, including the new 
Camp Rough & Ready
, which became a gold mining town and then seceded as a republic for about three months in 1850, until the neighboring towns started having 4th of July celebrations and they felt left out and rejoined the country.  The map is visually very attractive with calligraphy title and a large compass rose.  Marine  leagues are described on the map as 5564 meters - the standard today.   Surveyed by Andrew B. Gray, John B. Weller, Commissioner.

A clean and bright example, issued folding with a binding trim in the left blank margin that has been replaced with old paper and an adjacent tiny chip long the neatline that has been archivally repaired.  There are a couple of short fold separations that just enter the neatline at top and have been closed on verso with archival tape, and marginal toning along the top edge of the sheet.

This unique and rare map was published in Georg Leonhart Bauerkeller's 
Handatlas
, a loose-leaf color atlas that began as a subscription in 1844.  The maps were printed using multi-color lithography, with elevations in brown and water in blue, and further enhanced with hand coloring to identify boundaries and points of interest.  The majority of the maps, including this one, were carefully created by Ludwig Ewald.  Ewald used numerous sources in preparing this map, which are noted in the title and include Humboldt, Fremont, Emory, and Disturnell, among others.  Below the title is a numbered key to the states in Mexico, as well as a list of the heights of mountains and volcanoes in Mexico.  Texas is shown several years after gaining statehood, and is the only US state for which the boundaries are delineated.  Oklahoma is labeled 
Western Territory
, while to the west of Texas are 
Neu-Mexico
 and 
Ober-Californien
.  Numerous Indian tribes are noted throughout the region west of the Mississippi River.  A very attractive and uncommon map.

This map is one of the 
foundation maps for the western United States
 and represents the culmination of fifty years of government explorations.  Starting with Lewis and Clark, there were numerous official and unofficial surveys and explorations, all adding to the pool of knowledge presented here.  While large sections are still labeled ""unexplored territory,"" Emory fitted these fragments together with the information gathered during his surveys into a reasonably correct cartographic picture of the West.  This map shows large, transitional territories of Nebraska, Kansas, New Mexico, Utah, Oregon, Washington and Minnesota.  It was drawn by Thomas Jekyll under the supervision of Lt. Nathaniel Michler of the Topographical Engineers.  Lt. Michler worked with his counterpart representing Mexico, Captain Francisco Jimenez, to survey between Nogales and Yuma including the area south of Arivaca.

This example is quite clean and bright save for some very light offsetting at bottom and light toning along the top edge of the sheet.  There is one mis-fold in the title.

This work includes an important history on the Republic of Texas by Lorraine Thompson Pease and a history of South America and Mexico by John Milton Niles.  Included in the work are two maps engraved by T. Twitchel, engraved portraits of Generals Santa Anna and Houston, and an engraved frontispiece of the ""Battle of Jacinto.""  The first map, 
A Map of Mexico and the Republic of Texas
 (16.3 x 12.7""), is dated 1838 and features a young 
Republic of Texas
.  Settlements are confined to the eastern coast and include Houston, San Antonio, Galveston and Nacogdoches to name a few.  The states of Mexico are delineated and the map extends to show a portion of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.  The second map, 
Map of South America
 (14.8 x 19.4""), is also dated 1838.  This map is divided by country and shows the extensive river system throughout the continent.  There are several spurious mountain ranges and a number of cities are identified.


The 
Geographical and Historical View of Texas
 by Pease includes reprints of several important documents and accounts, including the Declaration of Independence, the Constitusion, Burleson's report on the 1835 Siege of Bexar, William Barret Travis' letter of February 24, 1836, and Benjamin H. Holland's report on the Fannin Massacre.  Pease was the father of Elisha M. Pease, who was a prominent participant in Texas affairs at the time.  Streeter notes that ""the value of this contemporary account of the Texas Revolution, compiled by the father of one of the participants, buried as it were in a rather bulky volume on South America, has been overlooked.""


This work was first published in 1837, with subsequent editions in 1838, 1839, 1843, and 1844.  Two volumes bound in one: 369 pp., frontispiece, 2 portraits, 1 map; 230 pp, 1 map.  Octavo, hardbound in full contemporary leather with embossing on covers and gilt titling and tooling on spine.

The folding maps have light toning and offsetting with a few spots of foxing.  The portraits and frontispiece are moderately to heavily toned and foxed (B), and the text is fairly clean and bright with light, occasional foxing (A).  The binding is sound and the covers and spine are moderately worn with some small abrasions.

This map is from the German edition of Duval's world geography.  New maps were engraved by Sigismund G.

This uncommon map covers the east of coast of Mexico and inland to include Mexico City.  The information was gathered from Spanish sources and Humboldts 
Carte Generale...Nouvelle Espagne
 (1809).  The 
Atlas Universel
 was the first atlas to present all the maps on the same scale (1: 1,641,836) about one inch to 26 miles, with each map covering an area of approximately 10 degrees longitude (from Paris) and 6 degrees of latitude.  It is also considered to be the first lithographic atlas ever published.  The maps were meant to be joined together to form a huge globe measuring 7.775 meters in diameter.  Only one edition of the atlas was published in 1825-27, and the subscription list shows that just 810 copies were sold; thus the maps are very scarce on the market today.

Goos' scarce map of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean was based on Hessel Gerritsz' map of the region published circa 1631, which influenced numerous derivatives.  Goos included updates from other derivatives, including the cartography of the Gulf of Mexico as depicted by Joannes van Loon, circa 1661, and the mildly sloped coastline of the Southeast U.S. as depicted by Hendrick Doncker, circa 1659.  However Goos' map was the first derivative to include Gerritsz' inset of the northern coast of Cuba, which fills the bottom left corner.  Goos also made some improvements, such as the depiction of the Outer Banks.  The map is adorned with two compass roses and the title appears on a cow hide held aloft by two cherubs.

Backed with tissue to reinforce and repair several centerfold separations at top and a 3"" tear just above the inset at lower left.  There is light, uneven toning and numerous repaired small chips and edge tears confined to the blank margins.

This handsome map focuses on the West Indies and covers the region from the Chesapeake through the Gulf of Mexico, with Central America and the northern part of South America.  Two lovely cartouches with cherubs and mermaids decorate opposite corners.  Eight ships sail the seas and three native canoes are depicted off the coast of North America.  A number of interesting cartographic myths appear on the map.  These include two large nonexistent lakes in the region of western Georgia and a non-existent mountain range extending from the Piedmonts bearing across the North American continent.  In South America, the archetypal cartographic myth, 
Manoa o' El Dorado
 (the golden city), is located on the shores of the 
Lacus Parime vel Roponowini 
in Guyana.  This is the second state with the addition of the privilege in the cartouche.

This is one of the earliest charts to name the bays of Galveston and Bernardo (now Matagorda) in Texas.  This first French edition was published just one year after the map on which it was based and is nearly identical: 
Carta Esferica que Comprehende las Costas del Seno Mexicano
 by Depósito Hidrográfico de Marina of Spain, which was the prototype for maps of the Gulf for many years.  
Carta Esferica
 was the first chart of the Texas coast based on actual soundings and exploration, and outlined the coastline and the lower course of its rivers.  The exploration was conducted by Jose Antonio de Evia in 1785-86, who named Galveston Bay after his patron, Bernardo de Galvez, the interim governor of Spanish Louisiana.


The chart extends from Florida to the Yucatan peninsula, and includes parts of Cuba and the Bahamas.  A note at bottom left explains that the soundings are given in French fathoms, and includes a lettered guide to the composition of the Gulf floor as indicated on the map.  Engraved by E. Collin with lettering by Besancon.  The seal of the Depot de la Marine is at bottom left and

This is the northwestern sheet of Ottens' 6-sheet map of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean depicting the theater of the War of Jenkins' Ear, part of the War of the Austrian Succession.  
The War of Jenkins' Ear
 had an improbable and theatrical origin.  After fifty years of colonial boundary disputes and growing trade competition in the New World, relations between Britain and Spain were extremely strained.  The war was named after Robert Jenkins, captain of the ship Rebecca, who claimed Spanish coast guards had cut off his ear in 1731.  Seven years later Jenkins was invited by a party of warmongers to tell his story and display his ear to Parliament, thereby inflaming British and colonial American opinion against Spain.  There was an increasing perception by the English that the Spanish were restricting their access to the slave trade in the West Indies.  This friction was aggravated by a continuing dispute over the border between Spanish Florida and Georgia.  These mounting issues compelled Prime Minister Walpole to declare war on Spain in October, 1739.


This map depicts the Gulf of Mexico from St. Joseph Bay, Florida to Veracruz, Mexico, and includes the tip of the Yucatan peninsula and the island of Cozumel.  Texas, which had been largely ignored on maps of the Americas, is shown on a large scale with excellent detail.  The mission at Cenis and 
Fort Francas
 are shown, and the routes of explorers La Salle and St. Denis are depicted.  The map also details the mouth of the Mississippi River and shows several important cities and forts, including New Orleans, Natchitoches, Fort Biloxi, Fort St. Louis, and Fort Carolin.  In the Gulf is a note in French and Dutch explaining that the distance from shore at any given point is equal to the depth in soundings.  Also shown is the route of the Spanish treasure fleets from Veracruz to Havana.


This map was first issued separately, as the Ottens' wanted to capitalize on the increased interest in the War of Jenkins' Ear, and published each sheet of the 6-sheet map as it was printed in 1740-41.  The full set of 6 maps was not available until June 1741, and the individual maps were also included in made-to-order composite atlases.  As a result, this map is not commonly found on the market.

A sharp impression with full original color.  Large chips confined to the bottom corners of the sheet (and not affecting the image) have been professionally replaced with period-correct paper.

Antonio de Herrera Y Tordesillas was the official historian of Spain and the Indies.  He compiled a history of the Spanish conquests and early explorations in the Americas, which included this simply engraved map of the Caribbean.  His work (
Historia general de los hechos de los Castellanos
) was originally published in 1601 with several editions and translations thereafter, all of which are scarce.  This map is from an early 18th century edition published by Nicolas Rodriguez, as evidenced by the name Florida appearing twice.  The cartography is based on the manuscript charts of Juan Lopez de Velasco (c. 1575-80).  This map is an excellent view of the Spanish presence in Florida, the West Indies and northern South America.  The distinctive narrow Florida peninsula includes a fairly accurate delineation of the 
R. de S. Matheo

Coronelli drew on many sources for his 2-sheet map of South America including several reports of voyages to which he had access.  Therefore the map is considered one of the best depictions of the era.  A small version of 
Lac de Parime
 is located on the equator with a notation questioning its existence.  The Rio de la Plata emanates from the large 
Lago de Los Xarayes
.  The route of Dutchmen, Jacob le Maire and Willem Cornelisz Schouten, around Cape Horn and through the South Pacific is traced.  This important voyage (1615-17) opened a new shipping route from the Atlantic to the Pacific and proved that Tierra de Fuego was an island and not a part of some massive southern continent.  From a purely decorative point of view, the map is a superb example of the mapmaker's art.  There are two large cartouches and the interior is filled with small depictions of animals and natives, including jaguars, llamas, hunters, torture scenes, and cannibalism.  If joined, the map would measure approximately 35 x 24"".  A superb large map of the continent.

Dark impressions on clean sheets with a number of short centerfold separations that have been repaired on verso with archival materials.  There is light toning along the centerfolds and one tiny hole above the title cartouche on the right sheet that has been professionally infilled.

The map draws on the cartography of Frans Hogenberg, Mercators world map of 1569, and Portuguese manuscript maps of Bartolomeo de Lasso.  It widens the gap between Asia and North America while properly locating the Philippines and Japan, although there is an odd 
Isla de Plata
 above Japan.  North America is depicted considerably narrower and more correctly at the Tropic of Cancer, and the head of the Gulf of California is shown in a new form with the 
R. Grande
 being introduced for the first time, although misplaced.  The large southern continent, 
Terra Australis
, stretches over the bottom of the map, but the name 
Tierra del Fuego
 appears south of the Strait of Magellan.  The map is adorned with two elaborate cartouches and Magellans surviving ship 
Victoria
 is pictured along with two smaller ships.  First state with the date 1589 in the cartouche.  Latin text on verso with printed number 6, published in 1592.

A strong impression with full original color on a watermarked sheet.  There is light toning along the centerfold, minor foxing mostly in the blank margins, and a short centerfold separation and short edge tear confined to the bottom blank margin that has been repaired on recto with old paper.

This very uncommon chart traces cylones, typhoons, and other storm systems across the Pacific.  The chart covers storms from 1831 to 1854.  It shows eastern Asia and North America with very little inland detail other than a few place names.  William C. Redfield (1789-1857) was an American meteorologist who was one of the first scientists to observe that hurricanes were massive circular vortexes.  He was the president of American Association for the Advancement of Science at its founding in 1843.

This important little American atlas is nearly complete with 62 (of 63) uncolored, copper-engraved maps of the world, continents and countries, and U.S. states and regions; 55 that are from the 1804 edition, plus seven additional maps (missing only Europe).  Of particular interest is 
Louisiana
, which is highlighted by the ""Mtns de la Roche or Stoney Mtns.""  Paul Cohen describes this map in 
Mapping the West
, that, although as equally inaccurate as the Soulard version, ""[the Samuel Lewis map] ... was the primary map of the newly purchased territory of Louisiana and its surroundings and, as such, reflected and shaped American popular geographical images of the western interior at the time of Lewis and Clark.""  Other American maps of note are early Tennessee, Ohio, Mississippi Territory, British Possession in America, and Spanish Dominion in North America.  The map of Australia shows an incomplete southern coastline, but a completely insular Tasmania.  Quarto, hardbound in quarter leather over marbled paper boards.

The maps range from good to near fine, with the majority being good (B) with toning and foxing.  Several desirable maps are in near fine (A) condition including North America, Australia, China and Japan.  The maps of South America and Asia are detached, and the map of the United States has a few manuscript notations in the image.  Covers are heavily worn and chipped.

This important and complete American atlas is from one of the country's earliest cartographers.  Each copperplate map is finely engraved in original, full hand color.  The atlas contains a total of 63 maps covering the world and continents with 35 maps relating to the Americas and 24 specific to the United States.  Cartographically, the map of the United States shows the western frontier consisting of Missouri, Arkansas Territory and Louisiana.  Further west is a huge Missouri Territory with a 
Huron District
 occupying Wisconsin and eastern Minnesota.  Eastern Texas is shown as a part of Mexico, but only one year from its independence.  The atlas features an early map dedicated to Oregon Territory that encompasses present-day Washington and extends well north into British Columbia, reflecting U.S. interests in the region.  Additionally, there are numerous state maps showing early county development including Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Mississippi to name a few.  Accompanying the map of New York state is the 
Map of the Country Twenty Five Miles Round the City of New-York
. 


David Burr was appointed to be topographer to the U.S. Post Office Department in 1832 and was therefore unable to complete the maps for this atlas. Thomas Illman assumed responsibility for the atlas, publishing it in 1835 using the New York firm of D.S. Stone. There is no publishing date on the title page, but the maps are all dated between 1831-35.  Hardbound in quarter calf with tips over cloth boards with gilt title on front cover.

Condition code is for the maps which are clean, bright, and in full original color with an occasional spot of foxing.  End papers and tissue guards have scattered foxing.  The hinges are starting, the covers are worn and stained, the edges are bumped, and there is a chip in the leather near the tail of the spine.

This complete atlas contains 60 single-page and 11 double-page maps of the world.  The first 21 relate to the ancient world and the remaining 50 are modern.  The modern maps consist of the following: World (2), Europe (27), Asia (5), Africa (3), North America (5), South America (5), and Oceania (3).  Of particular interest is the map of North America (
Amerique Septentrionale
) which still depicts Texas as a part of Mexico despite its publication date.  It also shows United States' claims in the Northwest extending well north into Canada, reflecting U.S. interests in the region (the French usually supported this position).  The atlas also includes three geological maps of Europe, France, and England, as well as a double-page Peutinger table.  Hardbound in quarter leather and tips over blue marbled boards.

Condition code is for the maps which range from very good to fine.  The maps in very good condition have occasional faint scattered foxing and a few have minor color offsetting.

This large-format atlas of the United States is complete with 30 double-page maps, including a double-page map of Rhode Island not called for in the table of contents.  Asher & Adams' Atlas was most notable for its excellent large-format maps of the states west of the Mississippi.  The atlas includes a world map on Mercator's projection, a map of Europe, a United States and Territories map, a geological map of the US, and numerous state maps.  The maps of Kansas and Nebraska depict the western portion of the states as largely unorganized, and the map of Texas only includes the eastern portion of the state.  An extensive index at the back indicates locations of money order offices, post offices, and railroad stations.  The atlas also includes populations by city, county, state, and territory for the US and part of Canada, as well as 10 pages of classifications of prominent firms of New York, Maine, and Cincinnati, Ohio.  Folio, 265 pages with title page, index of maps, appendix and maps.  Original binding with half calf over brown cloth-covered boards with gilt title on cover and spine and raised bands on spine.

The maps are very good with light toning and soiling and short edge tears on a couple of maps.  The text is bright with light toning only along the edges and an occasional spot of foxing or soiling.  The pastedown and endpapers in front and back are moderately soiled.  The front cover and spine are partially detached, and the spine and back cover have several chips.  The corners are bumped and the covers are lightly worn and soiled.

Joseph Scott was a Philadelphia engraver and publisher who engraved a number of important early state maps for Matthew Carey, a fellow Philadelphian.  In 1795, Scott published the 
United States Gazetteer
, which was the first compilation of state and territory maps issued in the United States (19 in total).  Scott engraved all of the maps, as he explains in his preface: ""The maps I have drawn and engraved myself, and I trust they will be found, on examination, as accurate as circumstances would admit, and probably more so than any collection of maps that has hitherto been published in the United States.""  His maps represent some of the earliest published maps of individual states and the western territory (here 
N.W. Territory
 and 
S.W. Territory
), and were drawn, of course, with Philadelphia as the prime meridian.  The associated text includes substantive information on the young Republic, with details on the history, geography, natural history, architecture, and more of individual states and regions.  This example is complete and contains a folding map of the United States at the front of the volume and 18 smaller maps interspersed in the text including: Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, New Jersey, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, N.W. Territory, S.W. Territory, Vermont, Virginia.  Of particular interest are: 


A Map of the United States
 (14.8 x 10.8"") extends to the Mississippi River with a large Louisiana to its west.  Georgia extends all the way Mississippi and Tennessee is 
S.W. Territory
.  A number of Bounty Land Grants are shown in the huge North West Territory, including those of the 
Illinois Company
, 
New Jersey Company
, 
Wabash Company
, 
Colonel Simmes
, 
Donation Lands from the State of Virginia
, and more.  The Seven Ranges also appear in eastern Ohio. 


The map 
N.W. Territory
 (7.2 x 6.0"") is the 
earliest printed map to show the North West Territory
.  It covers the region of the upper Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes, and shows the rivers and streams together with settlements, mines, and forts.  
Lit. Fort
 appears at the mouth of the Chicago River, and 
Old Ft. Orleans
 appears on the Missouri River.  The southern end of Lake Michigan is placed almost a full degree further north than the southern shore of Lake Erie, an error that resulted in a series of boundary disputes between Michigan and its neighbors in the 19th century.  The fictitious 
Charlevoix-Bellin
 islands appear in Lake Superior.  This is the first state with small, plain circle icons to locate the towns like Detroit and Sandusky.


The map 
S.W. Territory
 (7.3 x 6.0"") is the first state; later states of this map change the title to ""Tennassee.""  While simply drawn, the map includes interesting information including the locations of early settlements, military reservations, and Indian villages.  The 
Mero
 district is located and divided into three counties: Sumner, Davidson, and 
Tennassee
.  Nashville is here called 
Naskville
.   Fort Massac is shown on the Ohio River, and there is a note near Knoxville describing the way to Pensacola as being 
nearly level
.  The map includes a portion of the adjoining states of Kentucky and Georgia.

This school geography book by Horatio G. Spafford includes a map of the eastern United States suggesting a new name for the young Republic: 
Fredon
.  This is the first map to use the name Fredon, which Spafford suggests as a more appropriate name for the nation.  He writes: ""And, convinced as I am of its utility, I shall occasionally make use of FREDON, as a proper general generic term for the United States of America; and of the derivatives of FREDON, as occasion shall require. Thus Fredon, or Fredonia will form a national name for our country; the people thereof will occasionally be styled Fredes, or Fredonians, and our adjective epithet will be Fredish, or Fredonian. To every writer the convenience and even elegance of this arrangement must be particularly obvious.""  The name Fredon was originally coined by Dr. Samuel Mitchill in his 
Medical Repository
 in 1803.  The map, titled 
United States; or Fredon
 (9.8 x 7.8""), extends just past the Mississippi River into Louisiana Territory and identifies the locations of numerous Indian tribes.  Drawn by Spafford and engraved by G. Fairman.


Also included in

The map of Fredon is in very good condition (B+) and has been removed from the text and professionally conserved.  A binding trim at top right has been replaced with period-correct paper, and there is light toning along several folds and some minute worm holes.  The world map (B) has some toning, offsetting, soiling, and a professionally repaired tear that extends from the left edge of the sheet to Africa, with some stains caused by old cello tape that has been professionally removed.  A chip in the left blank margin has been replaced with old paper.  The text is toned with light foxing throughout and damp stains mostly in the latter half.  The front hinge has been professionally reinforced, and the back hinge is nearly perished.  The back cover is warped from damp staining and the spine has been professionally reinforced.

William Darby was an American geographer and cartographer of Irish descent.  At the end of the 18th century he was owned a cotton plantation in Mississippi Territory and gathered a lot of data for his later important mapping of the region.  In 1804 he gave up his plantation and took up a post of deputy surveyor in the United States General Land Office.  During the War of 1812 he served with Andrew Jackson as a topographer.  Darby wrote a number of books and articles about the southern states, many illustrated with maps.


Maps are toned with a little light offsetting and a few short fold separations, edge tears, and extraneous folds.  Text is toned with scattered foxing.  Covers scuffed, bumped, and nearly detached.  Spine is sound.

This fascinating volume, published by Jean Frederic Bernard, includes the accounts of various explorers in North America, two folding maps, and 17 engravings related to Native Americans.  The volume encompasses two works in one - volumes V and VI of Bernard's 
Recueil de Voyages au Nord
.  The first work is 
Relations de la Louisiane, et du Fleuve Mississipi...
, which describes the explorations of Louis Hennepin, Henri de Tonti, Bartholomew Gosnold, Martin Pring, and an anonymous officer's account.  Tonti's account, first published as 
Dernieres Decouvertes dans l'Amerique Septentrionale de ... La Sale...
, appears here in its second French edition as 
Relation de la Louisiane; et du Mississipi
 and is considered one of the most important histories of the Mississippi Valley in the 17th century.  Hennepin's account, 
Voyage en un Pays plus Grand que Europe, Entre la Mer Glaciale & le Nouveau Mexique
 is a later edition of his second book.  The second work is 
Recueil d'Arrests et Autres Pieces pour l'Etablissement de la Compagnie d'Occident - Relation de la Baie de Hudson, les Navigations de Frobischer, au Detroit qui Porte son Nom
, which describes the accounts of Martin Frobischer, Nicolas Jeremie, and M. Crosat.  The volume is accompanied by the following two maps:


A. 
Carte de la Louisiane et du Cours du Mississipi...
  This is a reduced-size edition of Delisle's influential map of the French possession of Louisiana that drew together the cartographic work of the previous half century and had a tremendous impact on the history of cartography.  When originally published in 1718, it was the first detailed map of the Gulf region and the Mississippi, and the first to show the explorations of De Soto, Cavelier, Tonty, Moscoso and Denis.  The map was designed for the political purpose of invalidating the English claims west of the Appalachian Mountains and laid claim to Carolina by the French, which provoked an angry English response.  The name Texas made its first appearance in print on the earlier edition of this map, with the legendary 
Mission de los Teijas
, established in 1716.  The notation of 
Indiens errans et anthrophages
 along the Gulf Coast warns of cannibals.  However, it is the cartography of the Mississippi Valley for which the map is notable today.  Due to the reduced scale, this edition omits the inset depicting the mouth of the Mississippi.


B. 
Les Cotes de la Virginie, les Detroits de Forbisher et de Hudson
.  This is the French edition of Pieter van der Aa's map of the North Atlantic that shows parts of the European, African and American continents with Iceland and Greenland at top.  From the report of Martin Pring's journey from England to New England in 1603, the sea routes of Captain Pring from the British Isles through the Azores to Plymouth are depicted.   Virginia extends into what is present-day Massachusetts as well as the Chesapeake Bay area.  The large title cartouche is surrounded by a fabulous scene of the colonists and Native Americans greeting each other.


Also included are 17 engravings related to Native Americans, with 14 of them based on John White's illustrations in De Bry.  408 pp., 253 pp., 100 pp., 2 folding maps, 17 single-page engravings.  Hardbound in vellum.

The map of Louisiana is a sharp impression with faint offsetting, a couple of rust spots, and light scattered foxing at top left.  There is a 1/2"" binding tear at far right.  The map of the North Atlantic was trimmed within the neatline at right by the bookbinder.  The plates and text are very clean and bright with an occasional spot of foxing.  The covers are lightly soiled and the spine has begun to crack.

This is the first German edition of Francois Marie Perrin du Lac's account of his voyage through the trans-Mississippi region.  Perrin du Lac arrived in New York in 1801 and traveled west along the Ohio River to St. Louis.  He then claimed to join a fur trading expedition in the summer of 1802 traveling up the Missouri River to South Dakota.  Perrin du Lac's account is known as one of the most important accounts of the Upper Missouri fur trade in the early 19th century.  His work included extensive information on the Indian tribes along the river, the Anglo-French rivalry in the fur trade, and the early history of Louisiana.  Although the veracity of his account has been substantiated, the source of his information has come into question.  Many scholars believe that Perrin du Lac did not make the journey up the Missouri River himself, and that his account is based on information obtained from fur traders in St. Louis, possibly Pierre Menard or Jean Baptiste Trudeau.


Accompanying his account is a map of the Missouri River and its tributaries, 
Karte von Missouri Aufgenomen und Berichtigt in Ihrem Ganzen Umfange von Frois Perrin du Lac
 (12.7 x 9.5""), extending from central South Dakota to where the river flows into the Mississippi River at St. Louis.  Howes claims that this map ""is the best of that region published at the time.""  There is excellent detail of the extensive river system and villages, with notations throughout.  The route of James Mackay's 1796 expedition up the Missouri River is also shown, and Wheat believes that this map was based in part on Mackay's original map.  Mackay's map was known to have been carried by Lewis & Clark on their famous trek west, and Perrin du Lac's map of Missouri represents the ""only published form in which the work of Mackay and (in part) of Evans could be found for upwards of a century"" (Wheat. p. 164). 


Perrin du Lac's account was first published in two French editions in 1805, and subsequently in one English and two German editions all appearing in 1807.  The French edition did not include a map, and the map in the German editions was a newly engraved, reduced-size edition of the original French map.  Also included in the French and German editions is a fold-out engraving of a mammoth skeleton from a museum in Philadelphia.

The 
Annales des Faits et des Sciences Militaires
 was a periodical that began in January 1818 and concluded in March 1819.  The publication was divided into three main parts: Military History, the Art and Science of the Military, and a Miscellaneous section to cover all other topics.  Numerous authors contributed to the volumes, which were published in 4 volumes; this example includes the first three volumes encompassing January through December 1818.  Included in these first three volumes are 5 folding maps and one engraved portrait of Thaddeus Kosciuszko by Ambroise Tardieu.  The maps are:

This second edition, two volume set was written by Giacomo Constantino Beltrami and printed in English for Hunt & Clarke in London.  Volume I of the 
Pigrimage
 is devoted to his travels in Europe and includes the folding 
Plan of the Town of Karlsruhe
 and 
Plan of the Gardens at Schwetzingen
.  The second volume is focused on his American travels, which included accompanying Major Stephen Long on an expedition in the upper reaches of the Mississippi River.  Long later wrote that Beltrami accompanied their party to Pembina and ""recently published a book which we notice merely on account of the fictions and misrepresentations which it contains.""  In 1826, the 
Revue Encyclopedique
 also heavily criticized Beltrami's work, which he responded to in the preface of this edition.  Illustrations in volume II include an untitled map of the Mississippi Valley (8.2 x 24.1"") from Lake Winnipeg to the Gulf of Mexico and 3 plates of Indian artifacts.  Volume I (472 pages) is rebound in quarter faux leather over brown buckram with gilt title on spine. Volume II (545 pages, uncut) is hardbound in quarter cloth over stiff paper boards with paper label on spine.

The folding maps are very good with occasional faint offsetting or faint foxing.  Text and plates are very clean and bright.  Volume I has a few minor scuffs along the spine, and volume II has light wear, faint stains on the covers, and bumped edges.

The U.S. Army expedition commanded by Captain Marcy was the first to discover the source of the Red River.  His report abounds in topographical and geographical detail with attention also paid to the customs of the native people in the southern plains.  It includes an impressive scope of data, including meteorological and natural history information, with emphasis on geology, paleontology, reptiles, fish, insects and botanicals.  Sixty-five beautifully lithographed plates are included, consisting of 12 lithographed views, 10 geological plates (inclusive of one hand-colored fold-out profile section), 6 paleontology plates, 18 zoological plates, and 19 botanical plates.  Of particular importance are the two folding map including with the report: 


Map of the Country between the Frontiers of Arkansas and New Mexico embracing the section explored in 1849. 50. 51. & 52.
, (59 x 27.5"").  This is a most informative map of the region illustrating the explorations of Capt. Marcy, with inputs from Col. Emory's Boundary Survey, Capt. Sitgreaves' map, as well as those of A.B. Gray and J. de Cordavas. It details the area from the Mississippi River to the Colorado, and from about 30° N. latitude to the Arkansas River. North of the Gila River the region is noted as 
Unexplored
, with a legend reading, ""In the vicinity of this place a tract of country is found which is said by several trappers to be exceedingly fertile, and abundantly timbered and well watered."" This erroneous note (in the Sonora Desert) shows up a decade later on A.J. Johnson's early maps of the Southwest. Filled with a copious amount of important information and detail on Oklahoma, North Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, the map locates exploration routes, Indian tribes, disputed territories, and more.  Wheat considers this map one of the best of the period that ""no emigrant could afford to be without it."" 


 Map of the Country upon Upper Red River explored in 1852
 (33.8 x 16"") is of special interest to Texas and Oklahoma collectors.  It covers an area in Texas wholly unexplored previously, including southwest Oklahoma (here Choctaw and Chickasaw Territory).  At the time, the only information on the region was from Indians and Indian traders.  The map details Marcy's route of exploration through this part of Texas with camp dates, the route of the train from Preston to Warren's T.H. at Cold Spring, Indian villages and settlements, topography and hydrology.  Filled with fascinating notations about the land and resources including a large profile of the entire region.  Earlier attempts at exploration had been thwarted by the Spanish; Capt. Sparks in 1806, Lt. Pike again in 1806 and Col. Long in 1819-20. 


Both volumes are bound in brown cloth with blind stamped covers and gilt title on the front cover of the maps, and gilt title on the spine of the report.  Octavo, 286 pages.

The maps are clean, bright and in unusually good condition with a few tiny fold separations where the map was glued to the boards and a bit of staining from the glue.  Plates are near fine, and the text is very good with occasional toning or scattered foxing.  The first 130 pages contain a damp stain in the bottom blank margin.  A previous owner's signature is on the title page, a page of text, and the verso of both maps (which does not show through).  Covers have light shelf wear with a stain on the front cover of the report.

This is the report of (then) Captain Simpson's explorations in Utah Territory during 1859.  While this report was submitted in 1861 it was not published until 1876 because of the Civil War.  The report covers a broad range of topics from geography, geology, zoology and history that Simpson observed as he explored a route from Camp Floyd (near Salt Lake City) to Carson City, Nevada.  This route was extremely important in the country's westward expansion as his route reduced the distance from the east to San Francisco by more than 250 miles.  Not surprisingly, it was quickly adopted by the overland mail, pony express and the telegraph.  This complete report includes 495 pp. of text, 22 illustrations and three maps.  The first map is entitled 
Map of Wagon Routes in Utah Territory
 (47.5 x 26"") which details Simpson's explorations as well as those of Fremont, Stansbury, Gunnison, and Beckwith.  The other maps are 
Map of Route of Father Escalante from Santa Fe to Lake Utah and Back by Way of Oraybe, Zuni & Acoma 1776-7
 (9.5 x 8.7"") and 
Lines of Equal Magnetic Dip
 (6 x 6.6"").  Quarto, hardbound in green cloth with faux leather title labels with gilt title on spine.

The map of Wagon Routes has light toning, minor offsetting, and separations along the fold intersections with a couple of small areas of loss, as well as a long separation at top left (B).  The two smaller maps have light toning (B+).  The plates are in near fine (A) and very good (B+) condition with minor toning mostly along the edges of the sheet, and an occasional spot of foxing, although one large folding plate has several fold separations.  The text is lightly toned.  The hinges are starting and the covers are lightly soiled with bumped corners.
